Here is the Python3 code for the problem:

```
# Define the function to calculate the number of apples
def number_of_apples(n, p):
    # Create a list to store the number of apples in each inflorescence
    apples = [0] * n
    
    # Place one apple in the first inflorescence
    apples[0] = 1
    
    # Iterate over the inflorescences
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Calculate the number of apples in the current inflorescence
        apples[i] = apples[p[i-1]]
        
        # Update the number of apples in the previous inflorescence
        apples[p[i-1]] = 0
    
    # Return the number of apples in the first inflorescence
    return apples[0]

# Read the input values
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the number of apples
result = number_of_apples(n, p)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This code defines a function `number_of_apples` that calculates the number of apples in each inflorescence. It takes two parameters: `n` (the number of inflorescences) and `p` (a list of numbers representing the branching pattern).

The function starts by creating a list `apples` to store the number of apples in each inflorescence. It initializes the list with zeros and places one apple in the first inflorescence.

Next, it iterates over the inflorescences, starting from the second one. For each inflorescence, it calculates the number of apples in the current inflorescence by checking the number of apples in the previous inflorescence (based on the branching pattern). Then, it updates the number of apples in the previous inflorescence to zero.

Finally, it returns the number of apples in the first inflorescence. The code reads the input values for `n` and `p`, calculates the number of apples using the `number_of_
