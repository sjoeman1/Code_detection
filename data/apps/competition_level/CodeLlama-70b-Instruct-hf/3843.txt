Here's the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def solve(n, m):
    # Calculate the number of digits required to display the hours and minutes
    digits_hours = len(str(n - 1))
    digits_minutes = len(str(m - 1))

    # Create a list to store the possible combinations of digits for hours and minutes
    combinations = []

    # Iterate through all possible combinations of hours and minutes
    for hour in range(n):
        for minute in range(m):
            # Convert the hours and minutes to base 7
            base7_hour = str(int(str(hour), 7))
            base7_minute = str(int(str(minute), 7))

            # Pad the hours and minutes with zeroes to match the number of digits
            base7_hour = base7_hour.zfill(digits_hours)
            base7_minute = base7_minute.zfill(digits_minutes)

            # Create a set of digits used in the current combination
            combination = set(base7_hour + base7_minute)

            # If the combination is unique, add it to the list
            if combination not in combinations:
                combinations.append(combination)

    # Return the number of unique combinations
    return len(combinations)

# Read the input
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the result
result = solve(n, m)
print(result)
```

The code reads the input, which contains the number of hours (`n`) and minutes (`m`). It then calculates the number of digits required to display the hours and minutes in base 7.

The code iterates through all possible combinations of hours and minutes, converts them to base 7, and pads them with zeroes to match the number of digits. It then creates a set of digits used in the current combination and checks if it's unique. If it is, it's added to the list of unique combinations.

Finally, the code prints the number of unique combinations, which is the result.
