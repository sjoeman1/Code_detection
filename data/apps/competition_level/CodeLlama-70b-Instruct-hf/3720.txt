Here is the Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```python
def find_winner(n):
    if n % 4 == 0:
        return "Petya"
    else:
        return "Vasya"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    winner = find_winner(n)
    print(winner)
```

This code works as follows:

*   It defines a function `find_winner(n)` that takes the number `n` as input.
*   Inside the function, if `n` is a multiple of 4, it returns "Petya" as the winner because in this case, Petya can always choose the second number and win.
*   If `n` is not a multiple of 4, it returns "Vasya" as the winner because in this case, Vasya can always choose the first number and win.
*   Finally, the main part of the code takes the input `n` from the user and calls the `find_winner(n)` function to find the winner.

This code should provide the correct output for the given problem.
