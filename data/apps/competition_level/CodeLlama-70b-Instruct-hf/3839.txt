Here is the code in Python 3:

```py
n = int(input())
print(n)

# Function to check if a cell is under attack of 4 or more knights
def is_under_attack(x, y, knights):
    for knight in knights:
        if abs(x - knight[0]) + abs(y - knight[1]) == 3:
            return True
    return False

# Initial placement
knights = [(1, 1), (3, 1), (1, 5), (4, 4)]

# Loop until there are at least floor(n^2/10) knights
while len(knights) < n * n // 10:
    # Loop over all cells
    for x in range(-10**9, 10**9 + 1):
        for y in range(-10**9, 10**9 + 1):
            # Check if the cell is not occupied and is under attack of 4 or more knights
            if (x, y) not in knights and is_under_attack(x, y, knights):
                # Place a new knight
                knights.append((x, y))

# Print the initial placement
for knight in knights:
    print(*knight)
```

This code starts with the initial placement of 4 knights (as shown in the example). Then, it loops over all cells and checks if the cell is under attack of 4 or more knights. If it is, a new knight is placed in that cell. The loop continues until there are at least $\lfloor \frac{n^{2}}{10} \rfloor$ knights. Finally, it prints the initial placement.

Please note that this code assumes the input is valid and does not include any error handling.
