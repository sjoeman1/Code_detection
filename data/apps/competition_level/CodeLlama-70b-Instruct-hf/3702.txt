Here's the Python3 code for the problem:

```python
# Input: n, a, d
# Output: b, e

n, a, d = map(int, input().split())

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

for b in range(2**64):
    for e in range(2**64):
        found = True
        for i in range(n):
            if str(a + i * d)[-18:] not in str(fibonacci(b + i * e))[-18:]:
                found = False
                break
        if found:
            print(b, e)
            exit(0)

print(-1)
```

This code iterates through all possible values of b and e and checks if the condition is satisfied for each of them. If a valid b and e are found, they are printed and the program exits. If no valid b and e are found, it prints -1.
