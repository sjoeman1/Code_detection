The input for the question is a single line containing two positive integers a and b. The output for the question is a single line containing the answer. The answer is the minimum positive value of x that satisfies the condition. If there is no such x, the output should be -1.

Here is a Python 3 code that solves the question:

```
import math

# Function to find the minimum positive value of x
def find_x(a, b):
    # Check if a = b
    if a == b:
        # If so, return 1.0 as the minimum value of x
        return 1.0
    # Check if a > b
    if a > b:
        # If so, return -1 as there is no such x
        return -1
    # Find the minimum value of x
    x = math.sqrt(2 * (b - a))
    # Check if x is a positive integer
    if x.is_integer() and x > 0:
        # If so, return x
        return x
    # Otherwise, return -1
    return -1

# Read the input from stdin
a, b = map(int, input().split())
# Find the minimum positive value of x
result = find_x(a, b)
# Print the result
print(result)
```

This code defines a function `find_x` that takes in two parameters `a` and `b`. It checks if `a == b`, and if so, it returns `1.0` as the minimum value of `x`. If `a > b`, it returns `-1` as there is no such `x`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum value of `x` using `math.sqrt(2 * (b - a))`. If `x` is a positive integer, it returns `x`, otherwise it returns `-1`.

After that, it reads the input from stdin, calls the `find_x` function, and prints the result.
