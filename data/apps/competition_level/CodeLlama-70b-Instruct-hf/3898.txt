Here is the Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```
def can_rearrange_statues(n, current_statues, desired_statues):
    # Check if the number of statues is equal to the number of islands
    if n != len(current_statues) or n != len(desired_statues):
        return False

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the statues and their positions
    statues = {}

    # Iterate through the current and desired statues
    for i in range(n):
        current_statue = current_statues[i]
        desired_statue = desired_statues[i]

        # If the current statue is not 0 (i.e., it is a valid statue), add it to the dictionary
        if current_statue != 0:
            statues[current_statue] = i

        # If the desired statue is not 0 (i.e., it is a valid statue), check if it is already in the dictionary
        if desired_statue != 0:
            if desired_statue not in statues:
                # If it is not in the dictionary, it means it has not been placed on the pedestal yet
                return False

            # If it is in the dictionary, check if it is adjacent to the current island
            if abs(statues[desired_statue] - i) != 1:
                # If it is not adjacent, it means it cannot be reached by the islanders
                return False

    # If all checks pass, it is possible to rearrange the statues in the desired order
    return True


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    current_statues = list(map(int, input().split()))
    desired_statues = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if can_rearrange_statues(n, current_statues, desired_statues):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

```

This code takes in the input parameters and checks if it is possible to rearrange the statues in the desired order. If it is possible, it prints "
