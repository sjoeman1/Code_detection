Here's the Python 3 code to solve the problem:

```python
# Input the initial element, lower index (l), and upper index (r)
n, l, r = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize a list with the initial element
arr = [n]

# Perform the required operations until all elements in the list are 0 or 1
while True:
    new_arr = []
    for x in arr:
        if x > 1:
            new_arr.append(x // 2)
            new_arr.append(x % 2)
            new_arr.append(x // 2)
        else:
            new_arr.append(x)
    arr = new_arr

    # Check if all elements are 0 or 1
    if all(x == 0 or x == 1 for x in arr):
        break

# Calculate the total number of 1s in the range l to r
ones = sum(arr[l-1:r])

# Output the result
print(ones)
```

This code first takes input for the initial element, the lower index (l), and the upper index (r). It then initializes a list with the initial element.

It then performs the required operations until all elements in the list are 0 or 1. It creates a new list for each iteration, and for each element in the current list, it checks if it is greater than 1. If it is, it appends $\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$, $x \operatorname{mod} 2$, and $\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$ to the new list. If it is not, it appends the element to the new list. It then updates the current list with the new list.

After all elements are 0 or 1, it calculates the total number of 1s in the range l to r by summing up the elements in the list from the lth index (inclusive) to the rth index (exclusive). It then prints the result.

Please note that this code assumes that the input will always be valid, and it does not handle invalid input or exceptions. It also assumes that the input will always be
