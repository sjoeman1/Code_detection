Here is the Python3 code that solves the question:

```python
# Input
b = int(input())
g = int(input())
n = int(input())

# Calculate the minimum number of decks
min_decks = n + 1 - min(b, g)

# Output
print(min_decks)
```

In this code:

* We take input for the number of boys, girls, and participants.
* Calculate the minimum number of decks as `n + 1 - min(b, g)`.
* Output the minimum number of decks.
