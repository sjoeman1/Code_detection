Here is the Python 3 code that provides a solution to the problem:

```
def minimum_bitcoins(hp_y, atk_y, def_y, hp_m, atk_m, def_m, h, a, d):
    min_bitcoins = 0
    while hp_y <= hp_m:
        hp_y += 1
        min_bitcoins += h
    while atk_y <= atk_m:
        atk_y += 1
        min_bitcoins += a
    while def_y <= def_m:
        def_y += 1
        min_bitcoins += d
    return min_bitcoins


if __name__ == '__main__':
    hp_y, atk_y, def_y = input().split()
    hp_m, atk_m, def_m = input().split()
    h, a, d = input().split()
    hp_y, atk_y, def_y, hp_m, atk_m, def_m, h, a, d = int(hp_y), int(atk_y), int(def_y), int(hp_m), int(atk_m), int(def_m), int(h), int(a), int(d)

    print(minimum_bitcoins(hp_y, atk_y, def_y, hp_m, atk_m, def_m, h, a, d))

```

The `minimum_bitcoins` function takes as input the initial HP, ATK, and DEF of Master Yang, as well as the HP, ATK, and DEF of the monster, along with the prices of HP, ATK, and DEF. It calculates the minimum bitcoins needed by Master Yang to purchase the necessary attributes to defeat the monster. The function returns this value.

The code begins by asking for user input for the HP, ATK, and DEF of Master Yang, as well as the HP, ATK, and DEF of the monster, and the prices of HP, ATK
