The following Python 3 code solves the problem:

```python
x, y, m = map(int, input().split())
steps = 0
while not (x >= m or y >= m):
    if x == y == 0:
        break
    if x < y:
        x, y = x + y, y
    else:
        x, y = x, x + y
    steps += 1

if x >= m or y >= m:
    print(steps)
else:
    print(-1)
```

This code uses a simple greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of operations. It first reads the input numbers x, y, and m from the standard input. Then, it initializes the number of steps to 0.

The code enters a loop that repeats until both x and y are greater than or equal to m. Inside the loop, it checks if x and y are both 0. If they are, it breaks out of the loop, as there is no way to make them both greater than or equal to m.

Otherwise, it checks which of x and y is smaller and adds it to the larger one. It updates the smaller number to be the sum of the two original numbers, and the larger number remains unchanged. This is a greedy step, as it aims to increase the smaller number as much as possible, hoping to eventually make it greater than or equal to m.

After each step, it increments the number of steps by 1. When the loop ends, it checks if either x or y is greater than or equal to m. If so, it prints the number of steps taken. Otherwise, it prints -1 to indicate that it is impossible to transform the pair to m-perfect.
