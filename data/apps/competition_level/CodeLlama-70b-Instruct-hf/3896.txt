The code for the question is given below:

```
n = int(input())
x = input()


def popcount(x):
    return bin(x).count("1")


def complexity(x):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if x[i] == '0':
            ans += pow(2, n - i - 1, 1000000007)
    return ans % 1000000007


ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans += pow(2, i, 1000000007) * complexity(x[i:])
    ans %= 1000000007

print(ans)
```

In this code, we first define the `popcount` function, which returns the number of 1s in the binary representation of `x`. We then define the `complexity` function, which calculates the complexity of the dance assignment for a given `x`. The `ans` variable keeps track of the total complexity of the dance assignment, and we print it after the calculations.
