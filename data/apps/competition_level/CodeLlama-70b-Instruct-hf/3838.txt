 I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected Python 3 code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
q = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, n+1):
    if q.index(i) + 1 != s[i-1]:
        print("NO")
        break
else:
    print("YES")
```

In this code, we first take input for the length of the permutation `n` and the number of moves `k`. We then take input for the permutation `q` and the Masha's permutation `s`.

We then iterate through the permutation `q` and check if the index of each element in `q` plus 1 is equal to the corresponding element in `s`. If this condition is not met for any element, we print "NO" and break the loop.

If the loop completes without breaking, it means that the described situation is possible, and we print "YES".
