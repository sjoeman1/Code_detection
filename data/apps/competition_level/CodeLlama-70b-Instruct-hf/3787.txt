Here is the Python 3 code for the question:

```
def get_sequence(n, a, b):
    if n < max(a, b):
        return -1
    elif a == b == 1:
        return n
    elif a == b:
        return get_sequence(n, a - 1, b)
    elif a < b:
        return get_sequence(n, a, b - 1)
    elif n == a:
        return [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    else:
        return get_sequence(n, a - 1, b)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    sequence = get_sequence(n, a, b)
    if sequence == -1:
        print("No such sequence exists.")
    else:
        print(" ".join(map(str, sequence)))
```

This code defines a function `get_sequence` that takes three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` and returns the sequence if it exists. The function checks if `n` is less than the maximum of `a` and `b`, and if it is, it returns -1. If `a` and `b` are both 1, it returns `n`. If `a` and `b` are the same, it reduces `a` by 1 and calls itself recursively. If `a` is less than `b`, it reduces `b` by 1 and calls itself recursively. If `n` is equal to `a`, it returns a list of integers from 1 to `n`. Otherwise, it reduces `a` by 1 and calls itself recursively. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block reads the input from the user and calls the `get_sequence` function with the input values. If the sequence exists, it prints the sequence, and if it doesn't, it prints a message saying that no such sequence exists.
