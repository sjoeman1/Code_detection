Here is the Python3 code for solving the problem:

```
# Input
format = int(input())
time = input()

# Extract hours and minutes
hours = int(time[:2])
minutes = int(time[3:])

# Check if the clock is in 12-hour or 24-hour format
if format == 12:
    if hours > 12 or minutes > 59:
        # Convert to 12-hour format
        hours %= 12
        minutes %= 60
        if minutes < 10:
            minutes = '0' + str(minutes)
        time = str(hours) + ':' + str(minutes)
    print(time)
else:
    if hours > 23 or minutes > 59:
        # Convert to 24-hour format
        hours %= 24
        minutes %= 60
        if minutes < 10:
            minutes = '0' + str(minutes)
        time = str(hours) + ':' + str(minutes)
    print(time)
```

This code will take the format and the time as input. It will then extract the hours and minutes from the time. If the format is 12, it will check if the hours and minutes are valid in a 12-hour clock. If they are not, it will convert the hours and minutes to a valid 12-hour clock. If the format is 24, it will check if the hours and minutes are valid in a 24-hour clock. If they are not, it will convert the hours and minutes to a valid 24-hour clock. It will then print the corrected time.
