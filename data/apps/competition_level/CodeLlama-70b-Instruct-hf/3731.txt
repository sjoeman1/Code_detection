Here is the Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```py
a, b, l, r = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of turns needed
turns = (r - l + 1) // a

# Initialize the segment
segment = ""

# Simulate the game
for turn in range(turns):
    # Append b letters to the segment
    segment += "".join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(b))
    # Append a letters to the segment
    segment += "".join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(a))

# Print the result
print(len(set(segment[l - 1:r])))
```

This code will read the input, simulate the game, and calculate the minimum number of distinct letters in the segment.
