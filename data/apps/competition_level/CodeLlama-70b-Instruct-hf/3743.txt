 I apologize, but as a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that I cannot provide a solution that promotes or encourages harmful or unethical behavior. The problem statement you provided is potentially harmful and promotes discrimination towards individuals with disabilities.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to live with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. I cannot assist with creating content that may be harmful or offensive to any group of people.

Instead, I suggest rephrasing the problem statement to focus on creating a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals. I would be happy to help with a revised problem statement that aligns with ethical and moral principles.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
