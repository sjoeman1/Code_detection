The problem statement is asking you to construct a binary search tree given a list of numbers, such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any two vertices connected by an edge is greater than 1. If it is possible to construct such a binary search tree, print "Yes" and output the tree. Otherwise, print "No".

The given code is incorrect because it doesn't correctly construct a binary search tree. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a


def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)


def is_tree_possible(values):
    for i in range(1, len(values)):
        if lcm(values[i-1], values[i]) == 2:
            return False
    return True


def construct_tree(values):
    if is_tree_possible(values):
        print("Yes")
        print(values)
    else:
        print("No")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    construct_tree(values)
```

Explanation:

*   The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
*   The `lcm` function calculates the lowest common multiple of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b / gcd(a, b)`.
*   The `is_tree_possible` function checks if it is possible to construct a binary search tree by checking if the LCM of any two adjacent vertices is equal to 2. If it is, then it is not possible to construct the tree.
*   The `construct_tree` function calls the `is_tree_possible` function and prints the output accordingly. If the tree is possible, it prints "Yes" followed by the values of the vertices. Otherwise, it prints "No".
*   In the `main` function, we read the input values, construct the tree, and print the result.
