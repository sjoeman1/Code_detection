Here's the Python 3 code for the problem:

```python
# Read the input strings
s1 = input()
s2 = input()
virus = input()

# Initialize a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences
dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(s2) + 1)] for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]

# Fill the dp array using dynamic programming
for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
    for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
        if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
            # If the current characters match, increase the length of the subsequence
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
        else:
            # If the current characters don't match, take the maximum of the lengths of the subsequences ending at the previous characters of both strings
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

# Initialize the result string to an empty string
result = ""

# Start from the bottom-right corner of the dp array and trace back to find the longest common subsequence
i = len(s1)
j = len(s2)

while i > 0 and j > 0:
    # If the characters at the current positions match
    if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
        # Append the character to the result and move diagonally up-left
        result = s1[i - 1] + result
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
    # If the characters at the current positions don't match
    else:
        # Move to the position with the larger subsequence length
        if dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

# Check if the result contains the virus substring
if virus in result:
    # If it does, print 0
    print(0
