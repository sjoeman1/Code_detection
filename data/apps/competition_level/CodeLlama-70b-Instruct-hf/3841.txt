Here is a Python3 program that solves the question:
```py
# Read the input
p, k = map(int, input().split())

# Check if the polynomial exists
if p >= k:
    print(-1)
    exit(0)

# Find the coefficients
degree = 0
coefficients = []
while p > 0:
    coefficient = p % k
    coefficients.append(coefficient)
    p = (p - coefficient) // k
    degree += 1

# Output the result
print(degree)
print(" ".join(map(str, coefficients[::-1])))
```
This program reads the input `p` and `k`, checks if the polynomial exists, and then finds the coefficients of the polynomial. Finally, it outputs the result.
