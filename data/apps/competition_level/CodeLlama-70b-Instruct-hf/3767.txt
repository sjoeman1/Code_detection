Here's the Python3 code that solves the problem:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

# Read the number of bottles
n = int(input())

# Read the amount of soda remaining in each bottle
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Read the volume of each bottle
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize a list to store the remaining soda in each bottle
soda = []

# Iterate through each bottle
for i in range(n):
    # Calculate the remaining soda in the bottle
    remaining = b[i] - a[i]
    # If there is remaining soda, add it to the list
    if remaining > 0:
        heappush(soda, (remaining, i))

# Initialize the number of bottles to store the soda
k = len(soda)

# Initialize the time to pour the soda
t = 0

# While there are more than one bottle in the list
while len(soda) > 1:
    # Get the bottle with the least remaining soda
    (min_soda, min_index) = heappop(soda)
    
    # Get the bottle with the most remaining soda
    (max_soda, max_index) = heappop(soda)
    
    # Calculate the amount of soda to pour from the max bottle to the min bottle
    pour = min(max_soda, b[min_index] - min_soda)
    
    # Update the time to pour the soda
    t += pour
    
    # Update the amount of soda in the max bottle
    max_soda -= pour
    
    # If there is remaining soda in the max bottle, add it back to the list
    if max_soda > 0:
        heappush(soda, (max_soda, max_index))
    
    # If the min bottle is not full, add it back to the list
    if min_soda + pour < b[min_index]:
        heappush
