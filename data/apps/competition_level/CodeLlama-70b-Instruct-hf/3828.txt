This Python code solves the problem using a greedy algorithm. It first creates a dictionary to store the position of each car in the train. Then, it iterates through each car in the train and checks if the car is in its correct position. If it's not, it swaps the current car with the car at its correct position and increments the number of actions required. Finally, it returns the minimum number of actions required to sort the train.
