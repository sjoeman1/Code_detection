 The Python3 code for the above problem is:

```py
from collections import defaultdict

n, k = map(int, input().split())
ancient_numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Function to find if there exists a winning strategy
def is_winning_strategy_exist(n, k, ancient_numbers):

    # Create an empty dictionary to store the counts
    count = defaultdict(int)

    # For each ancient number
    for c in ancient_numbers:

        # Calculate the remainder and increment its count
        remainder = c % k
        count[remainder] += 1

    # If there are two or more ancient numbers with the same remainder
    if max(count.values()) >= 2:

        # Then Arya has a winning strategy
        return True

    # Otherwise, Arya does not have a winning strategy
    return False

# Check if Arya has a winning strategy
if is_winning_strategy_exist(n, k, ancient_numbers):

    # Print "Yes" if Arya has a winning strategy
    print("Yes")

else:

    # Print "No" if Arya does not have a winning strategy
    print("No")
```

This code takes input from the user for n and k, and then the ancient numbers. It uses a dictionary to store the counts of remainders after division by k. If there are two or more ancient numbers with the same remainder, it means Arya has a winning strategy. Otherwise, Arya does not have a winning strategy.
