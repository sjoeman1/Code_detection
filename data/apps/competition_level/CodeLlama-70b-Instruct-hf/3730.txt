The problem statement is a bit confusing, but I'll try to provide a Python 3 solution that should solve the problem. Here it goes:

```
def find_longest_subsegment(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    longest_subsegment = 0
    start = 0
    end = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i-1]:
            end = i
        else:
            start = i
            end = i

        longest_subsegment = max(longest_subsegment, end - start + 1)

    return longest_subsegment

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = find_longest_subsegment(arr)
print(result)
```

The function `find_longest_subsegment` takes in an array of integers as input. It initializes the variables `n`, `longest_subsegment`, `start`, and `end` to keep track of the length of the array, the longest subsegment, and the starting and ending indices of the subsegment.

The function iterates through the array starting from the second element. If the current element is greater than the previous element, it updates the `end` index to the current index. Otherwise, it updates the `start` index to the current index and the `end` index to the current index.

Inside the loop, the function calculates the length of the current subsegment using the `end` and `start` indices and updates the `longest_subsegment` if the current subsegment is longer.

After the loop, the function returns the `longest_subsegment`.

The main function takes input from the user for the length of the array and the array elements. It then calls the `find_longest_subsegment` function with the array as input and prints the result.
