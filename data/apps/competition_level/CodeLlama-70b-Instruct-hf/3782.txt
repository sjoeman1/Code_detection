Here's the Python 3 code to solve the problem:
```
def solve(N, K, Q, A):
    A.sort()
    return A[Q] - A[Q - 1]

N, K, Q = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(solve(N, K, Q, A))
```

In the `solve` function, we sort the array `A` in ascending order. Then, we calculate the difference between the `Q`th element and the `Q-1`th element, which is the smallest possible value of `X-Y`.
