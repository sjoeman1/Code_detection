Here's a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

m = 0
operations = []

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i+1, N):
        if a[j] < a[i]:
            m += 1
            operations.append((j+1, i+1))
            a[i] += a[j]
            a[j] = 0

print(m)
for operation in operations:
    print(*operation)
```

This code first takes the input for N and the array a. It then initializes m, the number of operations, to 0, and initializes operations, a list to store the operations. It then iterates through the array a and checks if the current element a[i] is smaller than the next element a[i+1]. If it is, it adds the current element to the next element, making the next element 0, and increments m by 1. It then prints m, and the operations in the required format.
