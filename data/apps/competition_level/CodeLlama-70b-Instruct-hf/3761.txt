 Here's the Python 3 code that solves the given question:

```python
# Input the instruction sequence
s = input("Enter the instruction sequence: ")

# Input the x and y coordinates
x, y = map(int, input("Enter the x and y coordinates: ").split())

# Initialize the robot's position and orientation
robot_x = 0
robot_y = 0
orientation = 0 # 0 for facing right, 1 for facing up, 2 for facing left, 3 for facing down

# Iterate through the instruction sequence
for instruction in s:
    if instruction == 'F':
        # Move the robot forward
        if orientation == 0:
            robot_x += 1
        elif orientation == 1:
            robot_y += 1
        elif orientation == 2:
            robot_x -= 1
        else:
            robot_y -= 1
    else:
        # Turn the robot
        orientation = (orientation + 1) % 4

# Check if the robot's position matches the target coordinates
if robot_x == x and robot_y == y:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This code first reads the input values for the instruction sequence and the target coordinates. It then initializes the robot's position and orientation and iterates through the instruction sequence. For each 'F', the robot moves forward one unit in the current orientation. For each 'T', the robot turns 90 degrees clockwise. After processing all the instructions, it checks if the robot's position matches the target coordinates and prints the result accordingly.
