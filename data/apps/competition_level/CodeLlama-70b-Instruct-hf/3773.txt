Here is the Python 3 code for the given problem:

```
def solve(n, a, k):
    # Find the pile with the maximum value of A_i/K_i
    max_value = 0
    max_index = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] / k[i] > max_value:
            max_value = a[i] / k[i]
            max_index = i

    # If the maximum value is an integer, the first player loses
    if max_value == int(max_value):
        return "Aoki"
    else:
        return "Takahashi"


# Read input from STDIN
n = int(input())
a = []
k = []
for _ in range(n):
    a_i, k_i = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(a_i)
    k.append(k_i)

# Call the solve function to find the winner
winner = solve(n, a, k)

# Output the winner
print(winner)
```

The code first reads the input from STDIN, which is the number of piles N and the corresponding values of A_i and K_i for each pile.

Then, it calls the `solve` function, which finds the pile with the maximum value of A_i/K_i. If this value is an integer, the first player loses, and the code returns "Aoki" as the winner. Otherwise, the first player wins, and the code returns "Takahashi" as the winner.
