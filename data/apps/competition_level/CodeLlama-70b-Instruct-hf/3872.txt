 Here's a Python3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Input the two strings
s1 = input()
s2 = input()

# Function to check if two strings are equivalent
def is_equivalent(a, b):
    n = len(a)
    if n != len(b):
        return False
    if n == 1:
        return a == b
    return (a[:n // 2] == b[:n // 2] and a[n // 2:] == b[n // 2:]) or (a[:n // 2] == b[n // 2:] and a[n // 2:] == b[:n // 2])

# Check if the strings are equivalent
if is_equivalent(s1, s2):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

The `is_equivalent` function checks if two strings are equivalent by comparing them in two ways:

1.  Checking if the first half of `a` is equivalent to the first half of `b`, and the second half of `a` is equivalent to the second half of `b`.
2.  Checking if the first half of `a` is equivalent to the second half of `b`, and the second half of `a` is equivalent to the first half of `b`.

If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The main code checks if the two input strings are equivalent by calling the `is_equivalent` function. If they are equivalent, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
