Here's the Python 3 code that solves the question:

1.  It reads the input values for $n$ and $I$ from the first line.
2.  It reads the input values for the array $A$ from the second line.
3.  It calculates the value of $K$ as the number of distinct elements in the array $A$.
4.  It calculates the value of $k$ as the smallest integer such that $K \le 2^{k}$.
5.  If $k * n / 8 \le I$, it means that the file fits onto the disk without compression. In this case, it returns 0 as the number of changed elements.
6.  Otherwise, it iterates over all possible combinations of $l$ and $r$ (with $l \le r$) to find the minimum number of changed elements.
7.  For each combination, it counts the number of elements in the array that are outside the range $[l,r]$.
8.  If the number of changed elements is less than the minimum value found so far and the compressed file fits onto the disk, it updates the minimum number of changed elements.
9.  Finally, it returns the minimum number of changed elements found.
