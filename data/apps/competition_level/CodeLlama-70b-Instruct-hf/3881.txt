Here's a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def solve(n, q, operations):
    # Create a dictionary to store the possible operations
    operations_dict = {}
    for a, b in operations:
        if a not in operations_dict:
            operations_dict[a] = []
        operations_dict[a].append(b)

    # Create a list to store the number of ways to reach each length
    # from the previous length
    ways = [0] * (n + 1)
    ways[0] = 1

    # Iterate through each length
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Iterate through each possible operation
        for a, b in operations:
            # Check if the operation can be applied to the current length
            if i >= len(a):
                # Update the number of ways to reach the next length
                ways[i - len(a) + len(b)] += ways[i]

    # Return the number of ways to reach the desired length
    return ways[n - 1]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read the input from the user
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    operations = []
    for _ in range(q):
        a, b = input().split()
        operations.append((a, b))

    # Solve the problem
    result = solve(n, q, operations)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

1.  **Creating the Operations Dictionary**: We create a dictionary to store the possible operations. The keys are the first two letters of each operation (a\_{i} in the input), and the values are lists of the corresponding third letter (b\_{i}). This will make it easier to iterate through the operations later.
2.  **Initializing the Ways List**: We create a list `ways` to store the number of ways to reach each length from the previous length. The length of the list is `n + 1`, as we need to account for the initial length of 0. We initialize all the elements to 0,
