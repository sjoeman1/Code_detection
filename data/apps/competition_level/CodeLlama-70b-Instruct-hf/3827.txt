Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
def solve(s):
    a, b, c = s.count('a'), s.count('b'), s.count('c')
    return 'YES' if a == b or b == c or c == a or c == a == b else 'NO'

s = input()
print(solve(s))
```

This code defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input. It counts the number of occurrences of the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string and stores them in the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.

The function then checks if any of the following conditions is true:

1.  The number of 'a' is equal to the number of 'b'
2.  The number of 'b' is equal to the number of 'c'
3.  The number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'
4.  The number of 'c' is equal to both the number of 'a' and 'b'

If any of these conditions is true, the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

Finally, the code reads the input string from the user and calls the `solve` function with it. The result of the function call is printed to the console.
