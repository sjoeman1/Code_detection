Here's the Python3 code for solving the question:

```
def solve(n, k):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[i - j] * (k - 1) ** (j - 1)
    return dp[n]

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = solve(n, k) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The code first reads the input, which is the length of the sequence `n` and the maximum value `k` that each element can take.

It then calls the `solve` function, which computes the number of possible sequences. This function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` array is used to store the number of possible sequences of length `i` for each `i` from `0` to `n`.

The initial value is set to `1` for `dp[0]` because there is only one possible sequence of length `0`.

In the main loop, it iterates over the length of the sequence from `1` to `n`. For each length `i`, it iterates over the possible palindrome lengths `j` from `1` to `min(i, k)`. For each palindrome length `j`, it adds the number of possible sequences of length `i - j` multiplied by `(k - 1) ** (j - 1)` to `dp[i]`. This is because for each sequence of length `i - j`, there are `(k - 1) ** (j - 1)` ways to fill the remaining elements to make it a palindrome.

After the loop, the function returns the number of possible sequences of length `n`.

In the `main` function, it prints the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.
