This is a simple graph theory problem. We need to find the number of perfect matchings in a given tree. A perfect matching is a matching in which every vertex is matched. The number of perfect matchings in a tree can be found using the Tutte matrix. The Tutte matrix is a matrix whose ijth entry is the number of perfect matchings in the tree in which the vertices i and j are not matched.

Here is the Python 3 code to solve the problem:

```py
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the input
N = int(input())
edges = []
for i in range(N - 1):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((x, y))

# Construct the graph
graph = defaultdict(set)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].add(v)
    graph[v].add(u)

# Construct the Tutte matrix
tutte_matrix = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
for u in range(1, N + 1):
    for v in range(1, N + 1):
        if u == v:
            continue
        if u in graph[v]:
            continue
        # Construct a subtree by removing the edge (u, v)
        graph[u].remove(v)
        graph[v].remove(u)
        # Use depth-first search to find the size of each component
        visited = set()
        def dfs(node):
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    dfs(neighbor)
        dfs(1)
        # Calculate the number of perfect matchings in the subtree
        num_matchings = 1
        for component_size in visited:
            num_matchings *= (component_size - 1)
        # Update the Tutte matrix entry
        tutte_matrix[u][v] = num_matchings
        # Restore the graph
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)

#
