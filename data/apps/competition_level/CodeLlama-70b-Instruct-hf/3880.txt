Here's the Python 3 code to solve the problem:

```py
# Get the input
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the sum of the elements
sum_elements = 0

# Calculate the sum of the elements
for element in arr:
    sum_elements += element

# Check if the sum is positive or negative
if sum_elements > 0:
    # If the sum is positive, the maximum sum is obtained by changing the sign of the first n elements
    print(sum_elements - 2 * sum(arr[:n]))
else:
    # If the sum is negative, the maximum sum is obtained by not changing the sign of any element
    print(sum_elements)
```

This code first reads the input `n` and the array `arr`. Then, it calculates the sum of the elements in the array. If the sum is positive, it changes the sign of the first `n` elements, and calculates the maximum sum. If the sum is negative, it does not change the sign of any element, and prints the sum.
