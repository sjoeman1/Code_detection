In this problem, we need to find if it is possible to change the values of at most k cells in the table such that each connected component of the same values forms a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table.

Here's a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def solve(n, m, k, a):
    rows = []
    for i in range(n):
        rows.append(a[i])
    cols = []
    for j in range(m):
        col = []
        for i in range(n):
            col.append(a[i][j])
        cols.append(col)
    components = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if a[i][j] == 0:
                continue
            found = False
            for component in components:
                for x, y in component:
                    if (i > 0 and a[i - 1][j] == 1 and (i - 1, j) in component) or (j > 0 and a[i][j - 1] == 1 and (i, j - 1) in component) or (i + 1 < n and a[i + 1][j] == 1 and (i + 1, j) in component) or (j + 1 < m and a[i][j + 1] == 1 and (i, j + 1) in component):
                        component.append((i, j))
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                components.append([(i, j)])
    for component in components:
        if len(component) == 1:
            continue
        w = h = 0
        for x, y in component:
            w = max(w, x)
            h = max(h, y)
        w += 1
        h += 1
        if len(component) != w * h:
            return -1
    return k - len(components)


def main():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a =
