Here is the Python 3 code that solves the question:

```py
n = int(input())
s = input()

# Find the longest alternating subsequence without flipping
ans = 1
prev = -1
for c in s:
    if c != prev:
        ans += 1
        prev = c

# Find the longest alternating subsequence with flipping
i = 0
while i < n:
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:
        j += 1
    if j - i >= 2:
        flipped = s[:i] + ''.join('1' if c == '0' else '0' for c in s[i:j]) + s[j:]
        curr = 1
        prev = -1
        for c in flipped:
            if c != prev:
                curr += 1
                prev = c
        ans = max(ans, curr)
    i = j

print(ans)
```

In this code, we first find the length of the longest alternating subsequence without flipping by counting the number of times the character changes. Then, we iterate through the string and find the length of the longest alternating subsequence with flipping by flipping each contiguous substring and counting the number of alternating characters. Finally, we print the maximum of the two lengths.
