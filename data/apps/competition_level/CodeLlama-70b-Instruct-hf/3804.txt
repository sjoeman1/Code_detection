This code defines a function count() that takes two integers n and t as parameters. It iterates over the numbers from 1 to n and calculates the sum of values in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix. If the sum equals t, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count. The main function reads the input, calculates the count using the count() function, and prints the result.
