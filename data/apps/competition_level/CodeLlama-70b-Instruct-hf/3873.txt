The problem is asking you to determine whether it is possible to swap all pairs of positions in a permutation so that the permutation stays the same. If it is possible, you need to find a way to do it.

Here's a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
# Input the size of the permutation
n = int(input())

# Check if the permutation size is odd or even
if n % 2 == 0:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
    # For odd permutation size, print the swaps in reverse order
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        print(i, i-1)
```

This code will solve the problem and provide the required output.
