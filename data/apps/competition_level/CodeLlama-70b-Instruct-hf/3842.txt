Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```py
from math import inf

# Input
n, p, q = map(int, input().split())
a = [0] * (n + 1)
b = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i], b[i] = map(int, input().split())

# Precompute
ex = [0] * (n + 1)
money = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    ex[i] = ex[i - 1] + a[i]
    money[i] = money[i - 1] + b[i]

# Function to calculate answer
def solve(need_ex, need_money):
    if need_ex > p:
        return inf
    if need_money > q:
        return inf
    if need_ex == need_money == 0:
        return 0
    ans = inf
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans = min(ans, 1 + solve(max(need_ex - a[i], 0), max(need_money - b[i], 0)))
    return ans

# Call function
answer = solve(p, q)
print(answer)

```

The `solve` function calculates the minimum number of days required to meet the required experience and money. The `ans` variable stores the answer. If the required experience exceeds the maximum experience, the answer is set to infinity. Similarly, if the required money exceeds the maximum money, the answer is set to infinity. If both required experience and money are zero, the answer is set to zero.

The `for` loop iterates through the projects and calculates the minimum number of days required to meet the required experience and money for each project. The `min` function is used to find the minimum number of days required. Finally, the answer is printed.
