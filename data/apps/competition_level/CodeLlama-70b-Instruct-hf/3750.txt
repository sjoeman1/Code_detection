Here is the Python 3 code to solve the question:

```python
k, a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))

sets = 0

while a + b >= k:
    if a >= k:
        a = 0
    if b >= k:
        b = 0
    sets += 1

if a + b > 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(sets)
```

Explanation:

*   The first line of the code takes the input values for k, a, and b.
*   The while loop iterates as long as a + b is greater than or equal to k.
*   If a is greater than or equal to k, it resets a to 0.
*   If b is greater than or equal to k, it resets b to 0.
*   For each iteration, the sets variable is incremented by 1.
*   After the while loop, if a + b is greater than 0, it means the situation is impossible, and the code prints -1.
*   Otherwise, it prints the number of sets calculated by the sets variable.
