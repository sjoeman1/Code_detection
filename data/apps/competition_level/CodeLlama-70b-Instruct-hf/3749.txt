 Here is a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Read the input from the standard input
N, X = map(int, input().split())
A = [int(input(), 2) for _ in range(N)]

# Create a set to store the integers that can be written on the board
integers = set(A)

# Perform a loop to update the integers set
for _ in range(1000):
    new_integers = set()
    for x in integers:
        # Double each integer
        new_integers.add(x << 1)
        for y in integers:
            # Take XOR of each pair of integers
            new_integers.add(x ^ y)
    # Update the integers set with the new integers
    integers |= new_integers

# Count the number of integers not exceeding X in the integers set
count = sum(1 for x in integers if x <= X)

# Print the final count modulo 998244353
print(count % 998244353)
```

This code reads the input from the standard input, creates a set to store the integers that can be written on the board, performs a loop to update the integers set, and then counts the number of integers not exceeding X in the integers set. The final count is printed modulo 998244353.
