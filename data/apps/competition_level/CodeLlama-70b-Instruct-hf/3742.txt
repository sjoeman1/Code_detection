 Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
def get_minimum_complexity(n, bulbs):
    bulbs = [b for b in bulbs if b != 0]
    bulb_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    for bulb in bulbs:
        bulb_count[bulb] += 1

    # Check if the bulbs are already in the correct order
    is_ordered = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if bulb_count[i] == 0:
            continue
        if bulb_count[i] != 1:
            is_ordered = False
            break
        if i % 2 != bulbs[i - 1] % 2:
            is_ordered = False
            break

    if is_ordered:
        return 0

    # Sort the bulbs
    sorted_bulbs = sorted(bulbs)

    # Calculate the complexity for all possible positions of each bulb
    complexity = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        complexity[i] = complexity[i - 1] + (sorted_bulbs[i - 1] % 2 == i % 2)

    # Calculate the minimum complexity for each bulb
    min_complexity = 0
    for bulb in bulbs:
        min_complexity += complexity[bulb]

    return min_complexity


n = int(input())
bulbs = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(get_minimum_complexity(n, bulbs))
```

The code starts by reading the input, which consists of two lines. The first line contains the number of bulbs, `n`, and the second line contains the numbers on the bulbs. The code then uses a list comprehension to filter out the bulbs that have been removed, leaving only the bulbs that are still on the garland.

Next, the code counts the number of each bulb on the garland, storing the counts in a list called `bulb_count`. It does this by iterating over each
