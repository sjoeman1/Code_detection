1. The input consists of two lines.
 2. The first line contains the integer N, representing the number of cards.
 3. The second line contains N integers, x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, representing the numbers on the cards.

Here is the Python3 code:
```python
# Inputs
N = int(input())
cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the total number of prime numbers between 2 and the largest card number
def count_primes(n):
    prime = [True for i in range(n + 1)]
    p = 2
    while (p * p <= n):
        if (prime[p] == True):
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    return sum(prime) - 1

count = 0
# Iterate over all cards
for card in cards:
    # Add the number of primes between 2 and the card number to the count
    count += count_primes(card)

# Print the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective
print(count)
```

This code first reads the input, then calculates the number of operations required for each card. It then adds the number of operations for each card to find the total minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective.
