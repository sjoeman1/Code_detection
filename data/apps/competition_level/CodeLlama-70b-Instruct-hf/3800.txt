Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
# Read the input values
a = int(input())
s = input()

# Define the b matrix
b = [[0 for _ in range(len(s))] for _ in range(len(s))]

# Calculate b values
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(len(s)):
        if j >= i:
            b[i][j] = int(s[i]) * int(s[j])

# Count the number of rectangles with the desired sum
count = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i, len(s)):
        for k in range(j, len(s)):
            if sum(b[i][l] for l in range(j, k+1)) == a:
                count += 1

# Print the result
print(count)
```

The code first reads the input values `a` and `s`. It then defines a matrix `b` to store the products of each pair of digits in the string `s`. It calculates the products and stores them in the matrix `b`.

Next, it counts the number of rectangles with the desired sum `a`. It iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix `b`, checks the sum of products in each rectangle, and increments the count if the sum equals `a`.

Finally, it prints the result, which is the number of rectangles with the desired sum `a`.
