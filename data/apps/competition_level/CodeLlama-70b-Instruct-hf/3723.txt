 In this problem, we need to find the maximum number of Pokemon that Bash can take from the lab without them fighting among themselves.

Here's a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```py
# Importing necessary libraries
import math
import sys

# Function to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of numbers
def gcd_list(numbers):
    return reduce(gcd, numbers)

# Function to find the maximum number of Pokemon that Bash can take
def maximum_pokemon(strengths):
    # Initialize the maximum number of Pokemon
    max_pokemon = 0

    # Iterate through all possible subsets of Pokemon strengths
    for i in range(len(strengths)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(strengths) + 1):
            # Get the current subset of Pokemon strengths
            current_subset = strengths[i:j]

            # Check if the gcd of the current subset is 1
            if gcd_list(current_subset) == 1:
                # Update the maximum number of Pokemon if the current subset is larger
                max_pokemon = max(max_pokemon, len(current_subset))

    return max_pokemon

# Read the input
n = int(input())
strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find and print the maximum number of Pokemon Bash can take
max_pokemon = maximum_pokemon(strengths)
print(max_pokemon)
```

This code first defines a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. It then defines another function to find the gcd of a list of numbers.

The `maximum_pokemon` function takes a list of Pokemon strengths as input. It iterates through all possible subsets of the strengths, calculates their gcd, and updates the maximum number of Pokemon if the gcd is
