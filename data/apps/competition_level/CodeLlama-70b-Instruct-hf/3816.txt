This code will check whether the sticks can form a triangle or not. If the sum of any two sticks is less than the third stick, then it is not possible to form a triangle.

If the sum of all three sticks is less than or equal to `l`, then it is possible to form a triangle by increasing the lengths of all three sticks.

If the length of any one stick is less than or equal to `l`, then it is possible to form a triangle by increasing the length of that stick.

If the sum of any two sticks is less than or equal to `l`, then it is possible to form a triangle by increasing the length of those two sticks.

The code will calculate the number of ways to form a triangle and print the result.
