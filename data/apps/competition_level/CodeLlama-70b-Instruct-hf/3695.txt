Here's the Python 3 code for the question:

```python
n, T = map(int, input().split())
t = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
p = 0

for i in range(n):
    while p <= T and p < t[i]:
        p += 1
    if p > T:
        break
    if p == t[i]:
        ans += 1
        p += 1

print(ans)
```

The code first reads the input values n and T from the first line. It then reads the t values from the second line.

The code initializes the answer variable ans to 0 and the position p to 0. It then enters a loop that iterates n times. In each iteration, it checks if p is less than or equal to T and p is less than t[i]. If both conditions are met, it increments p by 1. If p is greater than T, the loop is broken.

If p is equal to t[i], it increments ans by 1 and increments p by 1. This indicates that the dog has eaten from the current bowl and moves to the next bowl.

Finally, the code prints the answer, which is the maximum number of bowls the dog can eat in T seconds.
