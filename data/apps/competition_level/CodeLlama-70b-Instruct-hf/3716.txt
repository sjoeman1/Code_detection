Here is the Python3 code for the question:

```
def lcm(a, b):
    return (a*b)//gcd(a,b)

n = int(input())

result = 1
for i in range(1, n+1):
    result = lcm(result, i)

print(result)
```

The `lcm` function calculates the LCM of two numbers using the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) formula.

The `for` loop iterates through all the numbers from 1 to n, calculating the LCM of each number with the previous result.

Finally, the `print` statement prints the final result.

Note that this code assumes that the GCD function is already defined. You can define the GCD function using the Euclidean algorithm if needed.
