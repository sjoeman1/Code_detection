Here is the Python3 code that solves the question:

```python
def is_cube(lines):
    # Check if the given lines represent a cube.
    points = []
    for line in lines:
        points.append(tuple(map(int, line.split())))
    for i in range(len(points)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
            diff = [points[i][k] - points[j][k] for k in range(3)]
            if diff not in points:
                return False
    return True

lines = []
for _ in range(8):
    lines.append(input())

if is_cube(lines):
    print("YES")
    for line in lines:
        print(line)
else:
    print("NO")
```

This code takes 8 lines as input, each containing three space-separated integers representing the coordinates of a vertex of the cube. Then it calls the `is_cube` function to check if the given lines represent a cube. If they do, it prints "YES" and the original coordinates. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
