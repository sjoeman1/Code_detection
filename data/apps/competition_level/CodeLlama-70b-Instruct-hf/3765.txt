The code for this problem is given below:

```
# Input

a, b, h, w, n = map(int, input().split())
a_i = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Define function to check if the rectangle can be placed
def check(h, w):
    return a <= h and b <= w

# Check if the rectangle can be placed on the initial field
if check(h, w):
    print(0)
    exit()

# Initialize the number of extensions needed
ans = 0

# Loop through all extensions
for a_i in a_i:
    # Check if the rectangle can be placed after using the extension
    if check(a_i * h, w) or check(h, a_i * w):
        # If yes, increase the number of extensions needed
        ans += 1
        break

# Check if it is possible to place the rectangle on the field
if ans == 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(ans)
```

The code first reads the input and defines a function to check if the rectangle can be placed on the field. Then, it checks if the rectangle can be placed on the initial field. If not, it loops through all extensions and checks if the rectangle can be placed after using each extension. If it can, it increases the number of extensions needed and breaks the loop. Finally, it checks if the number of extensions needed is 0 (meaning it's not possible to place the rectangle) and prints the result accordingly.
