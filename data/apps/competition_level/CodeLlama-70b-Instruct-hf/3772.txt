 Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Input the integers a and b
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the number of resistors as 0
resistors = 0

# While the numerator is not equal to 1
while a != 1:
    # If the numerator is divisible by the denominator
    if a % b == 0:
        # Divide the numerator by the denominator
        a //= b
        # Increment the number of resistors by 1
        resistors += 1
    # If the numerator is not divisible by the denominator
    else:
        # Increment the numerator by the denominator
        a += b
        # Increment the number of resistors by 1
        resistors += 1

# Print the number of resistors
print(resistors)
```

This code takes the input `a` and `b`, calculates the smallest number of resistors needed to assemble an element with a resistance equal to the fraction `a/b`, and prints the result.
