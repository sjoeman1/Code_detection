The question is asking to find the minimum mass of fuel required for Natasha to fly to Mars and back to Earth. The input consists of the number of planets, the weight of the payload, and the coefficients for take-off and landing. The output is the minimum mass of fuel or -1 if it is not possible.

The code for this problem can be written as follows:

```
# Define a function to calculate the minimum fuel mass
def min_fuel(n, m, a, b):
    # Initialize the fuel mass to 0
    fuel = 0
    
    # Iterate through each planet
    for i in range(n-1):
        # Calculate the amount of fuel required for take-off
        takeoff = m * a[i]
        # Calculate the amount of fuel required for landing
        landing = m * b[i]
        
        # If the fuel is greater than the takeoff, subtract the takeoff from the fuel
        if fuel >= takeoff:
            fuel -= takeoff
        # Otherwise, add the takeoff to the fuel
        else:
            fuel += takeoff
        
        # If the fuel is greater than the landing, subtract the landing from the fuel
        if fuel >= landing:
            fuel -= landing
        # Otherwise, add the landing to the fuel
        else:
            fuel += landing
            
    # If the fuel is greater than the payload, subtract the payload from the fuel
    if fuel >= m:
        fuel -= m
    # Otherwise, add the payload to the fuel
    else:
        fuel += m
        
    # If the fuel is negative, return -1
    if fuel < 0:
        return -1
    # Otherwise, return the fuel
    else:
        return fuel

# Read input from stdin
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Call the function to calculate the minimum fuel mass
result = min_fuel(n, m, a, b)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

The function `min_fuel` calculates the minimum fuel mass required for Natasha to fly to
