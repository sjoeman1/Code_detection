 Here's a solution using Python3 that should work for the problem you described. This solution sorts the list of numbers, computes the sum of the first n elements and the last n elements, and then iterates through the list, rounding each number and updating the sums as necessary. The minimum difference is then computed and printed.
```python
import sys

def solve():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    numbers = list(map(float, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    if n % 2 == 1:
        numbers.append(0)
    numbers += numbers[:n]
    numbers.sort()
    sum1 = sum(numbers[:2*n])
    sum2 = sum(numbers[-2*n:])
    diff = abs(sum1 - sum2)
    for i in range(n):
        sum1 -= numbers[i]
        sum2 += numbers[i]
        numbers[i] = int(numbers[i])
        sum1 += numbers[i]
        sum2 -= numbers[i]
        new_diff = abs(sum1 - sum2)
        if new_diff < diff:
            diff = new_diff
    print(diff)

solve()
```
