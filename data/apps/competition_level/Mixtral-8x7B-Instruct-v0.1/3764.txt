 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def solve():
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    for _ in range(k):
        for i in range(1, len(arr), 2):
            arr[i] = arr[i] ^ x
    print(max(arr), min(arr))

solve()
```

This solution takes the number of rangers `n`, the number of times Jon will carry out the operation `k`, and Jon's favorite number `x` as input. It then reads in the strengths of the rangers and sorts them in increasing order. After that, it performs the XOR operation `k` times as specified, by iterating through the array with a step of 2 and updating the elements with the XOR of their current value and `x`. Finally, it prints the maximum and minimum strength of the rangers after performing the operation `k` times.
