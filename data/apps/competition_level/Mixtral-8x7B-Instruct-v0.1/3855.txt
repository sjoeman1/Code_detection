 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import math

def min_number_of_packets(n):
    # Calculate the smallest integer greater than or equal to log base 2 of n
    num_packets = math.ceil(math.log2(n))

    # Return the smallest integer that is a power of 2 which is greater than or equal to n
    return int(2 ** num_packets)

# Read the input number
n = int(input())

# Print the minimum number of packets
print(min_number_of_packets(n))
```

The solution works by finding the smallest integer that is a power of 2 which is greater than or equal to n. This is because a power of 2 has the property that any number less than or equal to it can be formed by adding together some (possibly one or all) of its bits.

For example, if n = 6, then the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n is 8, which has bits 1000. To form 6, we can add together the bits 1, 2, and 3, which correspond to the packets with 1, 2, and 3 coins, respectively.

To find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n, we can take the log base 2 of n and round it up to the nearest integer. This is because the log base 2 of a number is the number of bits required to represent that number in binary. By rounding up, we ensure that the resulting number has at least as many bits as n.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), which is sufficient for the given input constraints. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of memory to store the input number and the result.
