 To solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the expected number of black stones for each possible state of the board. The state of the board can be represented as a pair (l, r), where l is the number of black squares to the left of the marked square, and r is the number of black squares to the right of the marked square. We can precompute the expected number of black stones for each possible state, and then look up the answer for each value of s.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def inv(x):
    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)

def solve(n):
    dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = dp[0][1] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1]) % MOD
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i][1] = (dp[i][1] + dp[i - j - 1][0] + dp[i - j - 1][1]) % MOD
    return dp[n][0] * inv(2) % MOD

n = int(input())
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(solve(i))
```

The `inv` function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the extended Euclidean algorithm. The `solve` function calculates the expected number of black stones for a given state of the board, represented as a pair (l, r). The main function reads the value of n from standard input and prints the expected number of black stones for each value of s from 1 to n.
