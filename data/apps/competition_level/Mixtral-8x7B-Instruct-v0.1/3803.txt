 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min_bitcoins_to_win():
    hp_y, atk_y, def_y = map(int, input().split())
    hp_m, atk_m, def_m = map(int, input().split())
    h, a, d = map(int, input().split())

    # Increase HP of Master Yang until he is strong enough to survive one attack from the monster
    while (hp_m > 0 and atk_m > def_y) or (hp_m > def_y and atk_m >= def_y):
        hp_y += 1
        cost = h + (a if atk_m > def_y else 0) + (d if atk_m == def_y else 0)
        if hp_y * h > cost * hp_m:
            break

    print(cost * hp_m)

min_bitcoins_to_win()
```

The solution works by increasing the HP of Master Yang until he is strong enough to survive one attack from the monster. At each step, the solution calculates the cost of increasing HP, ATK, and DEF, and compares it to the cost of increasing HP only. If the cost of increasing HP only is less than the total cost, then it is more efficient to increase HP only. The solution continues until Master Yang can survive one attack from the monster, at which point the monster's HP will decrease to 0 in the next second. The solution then prints the total cost of increasing HP to the required level.

Note that this solution assumes that the input is valid and satisfies the given constraints. If the input is not valid, then the solution may not work correctly.
