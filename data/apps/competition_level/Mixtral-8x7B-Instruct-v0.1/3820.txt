 Here is one way to solve the problem using Python:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
t = input()

i, j = 0, 0
while i < n and j < m:
    if s[i] == '*':
        i += 1
        continue
    if s[i] != t[j]:
        break
    i += 1
    j += 1

if i < n:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
```

This solution uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate over the strings `s` and `t` simultaneously. If the current character in `s` is a wildcard character `*`, we skip it and move on to the next character in `s`. If the current characters in `s` and `t` are not equal, then `t` does not match the pattern `s` and we print "NO". Otherwise, we continue until we have iterated over all characters in `s` and `t`, at which point we print "YES".
