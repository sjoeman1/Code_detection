 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def eat\_as\_many\_bowls\_as\_possible(n, T, t):
t = [0] + t
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[max(0, i - t[i])] + 1)
return dp[n]

n, T = map(int, input().split())
t = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(eat\_as\_many\_bowls\_as\_possible(n, T, t))
```

The solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` array is used to store the maximum number of bowls that can be eaten up to the `i`-th bowl. For each bowl, the dog has two options: to eat the bowl or to skip it. If the dog decides to eat the bowl, then the maximum number of bowls that can be eaten is `dp[i-1] + 1` (where `dp[i-1]` is the maximum number of bowls that can be eaten up to the `i-1`-th bowl, and `1` is the bowl that the dog just ate). If the dog decides to skip the bowl, then the maximum number of bowls that can be eaten is `dp[i-t[i]-1] + 1` (where `dp[i-t[i]-1]` is the maximum number of bowls that can be eaten up to the `i-t[i]`-th bowl, and `1` is the bowl that the dog skipped). The maximum number of bowls that can be eaten is the maximum of these two options.

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` and the space complexity is also `O(n)`.
