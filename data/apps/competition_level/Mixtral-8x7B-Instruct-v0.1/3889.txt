 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def can_standardize_puppies():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()

    count = {}
    for c in s:
        count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1

    # If there is only one color, then all puppies are already standardized
    if len(count) == 1:
        print("Yes")
        return

    # Check if there are at least two puppies of each color
    for num_puppies in count.values():
        if num_puppies == 1:
            print("No")
            return

    print("Yes")

can_standardize_puppies()
```

The solution first counts the number of puppies for each color using a dictionary. If there is only one color, then all puppies are already standardized. Otherwise, it checks if there are at least two puppies of each color. If not, then it is impossible to recolor the puppies. If yes, then it is possible to standardize the puppies. The solution prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
