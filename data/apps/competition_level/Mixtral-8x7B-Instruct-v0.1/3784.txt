 To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of graph theory and dynamic programming. Here is the Python3 code for the problem:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 1000000007

def power(x, y):
    res = 1
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = (res * x) % MOD
        x = (x * x) % MOD
        y >>= 1
    return res

def dfs(cur, pre, vis, sum_vis):
    if cur == n + 2:
        if sum_vis - vis[0] - vis[1] == m:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0
    ret = 0
    for i in range(n + 2):
        if not vis[i] and (not pre or i != pre):
            vis[i] = 1
            sum_vis += 1
            ret += dfs(cur + 1, i, vis, sum_vis)
            sum_vis -= 1
            vis[i] = 0
    return ret

def solve(n, m):
    vis = [0] * (n + 2)
    vis[0] = vis[1] = 1
    return dfs(2, 0, vis, 2) * power(2, n - 1) % MOD

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(solve(n, m))
```

The code first calculates the number of non-similar worlds that can be built using dynamic programming and then multiplies the result by `2^(n-1)` to account for the number of ways to connect the new vertices to the existing path. The `power` function is used to calculate `2^(n-1)` efficiently. The `dfs` function is used to calculate the number of non-similar worlds that can be built with a fixed path from `s(G)` to `t(G)`. The `vis` array is used to keep track of the visited vertices and
