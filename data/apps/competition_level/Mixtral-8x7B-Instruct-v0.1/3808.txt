 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def is_correct(s):
    count = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            count += 1
        else:
            if count == 0:
                return False
            count -= 1
    return count == 0

def can_fix(n, s):
    if is_correct(s):
        return False
    for i in range(n):
        if is_correct(s[:i] + s[i+1:]):
            return True
    return False

n = int(input())
s = input()
if can_fix(n, s):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

The function `is_correct` checks if a given bracket sequence is correct or not. The function `can_fix` checks if it is possible to make the given bracket sequence correct by moving at most one bracket. If the given sequence is already correct, then it returns `False`. The main program reads the input and calls the function `can_fix` and prints the result accordingly.
