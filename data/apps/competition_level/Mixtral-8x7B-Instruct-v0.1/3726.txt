 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def solve():
    N = int(input().strip())
    x = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    ans = 0
    while True:
        flipped = set()
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if i % 2 == 1 and is_prime(i):
                for j in range(max(0, x[0] - i // 2), min(N, x[-1] + i // 2) + 1):
                    flipped.add(x[j])
        if len(flipped) == 0:
            break
        for i in range(N):
            if x[i] in flipped:
                x[i] = -x[i]
        ans += 1
    print(ans)

solve()
```

The solution uses a greedy approach to flip as many cards as possible in each operation. It repeatedly selects the smallest prime number greater than or equal to 3 that has not been used before and flips all the cards that can be reached by moving that many steps from any face-up card. The process is repeated until all cards are face down. The function `is_prime` is used to check if a number is prime. The function `solve` contains the main logic of the solution. It reads the input, initializes the answer variable `ans` to 0, and enters a while loop that continues until all cards are face down. In each iteration of the loop, it initializes a set `flipped` to keep track of the cards that are flipped in the current operation. Then, it iterates over all the cards and checks if they can be reached by moving a prime number of steps from any face-up card. If they can, they are added to the set `flipped`. After all the cards have been checked, if the set `flipped` is empty, it means that all cards
