 Here's a dynamic programming solution for the problem:

```python3
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def max\_profit():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split())) + [0] * (n + 1)

    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][j] for j in range(n + 1))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(l[i - 1] + 1, m) + 1):
            dp[j][i] = max(dp[j][i - 1], dp[j - 1][i - 1] + s[i - 1] + c[j])
        for j in range(min(l[i - 1] + 1, m) + 1, m + 1):
            dp[j][i] = dp[j][i - 1]

    return max(dp[m])

print(max\_profit())
```

The idea is to use a 2D dynamic programming array `dp[i][j]` to store the maximum profit that can be achieved with `i` aggressiveness levels and `j` candidates. We initialize `dp[0]` with the maximum profit that can be achieved without any candidates, which is 0. Then, we iterate over the candidates and aggressiveness levels, and for each candidate `i` and aggressiveness level `j`, we update `dp[j][i]` with the maximum profit that can be achieved. If the current candidate's aggressiveness level is less than or equal to `j`, we have two options: either we recruit the current candidate or we don't. If we recruit the current candidate, we add the recruitment cost and the profit from the current aggressiveness level to `dp[j - 1][i
