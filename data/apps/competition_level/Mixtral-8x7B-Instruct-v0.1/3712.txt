 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
students = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the total number of students
total_students = sum(students)

# Calculate the number of compartments that need to be filled
need_to_fill = total_students - 3 * (total_students // 4)

# Print the result
print(need_to_fill)
```

This solution works by first calculating the total number of students in the carriage. Then, it calculates the number of compartments that need to be filled with additional students in order to have a company of three or four students in each compartment. This is done by dividing the total number of students by 4 (the maximum number of students in a compartment) and subtracting the remainder, since each group of four students contributes exactly 3 to the total number of students. The number of compartments that need to be filled is then the difference between the total number of students and the number of students in full compartments. If this number is negative, it means that there are already enough students in the carriage, so the answer is 0.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
