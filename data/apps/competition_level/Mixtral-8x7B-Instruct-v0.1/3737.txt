 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
strengths = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Count the number of stewards that Jon Snow can support
count = 0
for strength in strengths:
    if strength > 0 and strengths.count(strength - 1) > 0 and strengths.count(strength + 1) > 0:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

This solution first reads the number of stewards `n` and their strengths from the input. Then, it iterates through the list of strengths and checks for each steward if there exists at least one steward with a strength strictly less than it and at least one steward with a strength strictly greater than it. If such a steward is found, the count of stewards that Jon Snow can support is incremented. Finally, the solution prints the count of such stewards.
