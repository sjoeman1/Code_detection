 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import math

def max_colors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return int(math.log2(n)) + 1
    else:
        return int(math.log2(n // 2)) + 2

n = int(input())
print(max_colors(n))
```

The function `max_colors` calculates the maximum number of different colors that Ujan can use to paint the path. If `n` is 1, then only one color is needed. If `n` is even, then the maximum number of colors is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` plus one (because two consecutive tiles cannot have the same color). If `n` is odd, then the maximum number of colors is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n // 2` plus two (because the first and last tiles must have the same color, and two consecutive tiles cannot have the same color).
