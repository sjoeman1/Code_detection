 Here is a Python3 code that can solve the problem:
```python
def count_bulbasaurs(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of Bulbasaurs
    count = 0

    # Loop until the entire string has been processed
    while len(s) > 0:
        # Try to find a Bulbasaur in the string
        if s.find("Bulbasaur") == 0:
            # If found, increment the count and remove the Bulbasaur from the string
            count += 1
            s = s[len("Bulbasaur"):].lower()
        else:
            # If not found, remove the first character from the string
            s = s[1:].lower()

    # Return the count of Bulbasaurs
    return count

# Get the string from the user
s = input()

# Print the result
print(count_bulbasaurs(s))
```
The code defines a function `count_bulbasaurs` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of Bulbasaurs that can be formed from the string. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly search for a Bulbasaur in the string. If a Bulbasaur is found, it is removed from the string and the count of Bulbasaurs is incremented. If a Bulbasaur is not found, the first character is removed from the string. The function continues this process until the entire string has been processed.

The code then gets the string from the user and prints the result of calling the `count_bulbasaurs` function on the string.
