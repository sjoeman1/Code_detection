 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import sys
from collections import deque

# Read input
s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())

# Initialize the current direction and position
direction = 0  # 0: right, 1: up, 2: left, 3: down
position = [0, 0]

# Simulate the robot movement
for cmd in s:
    if cmd == 'F':
        position[direction % 2] += 1 if direction < 2 else -1
    elif cmd == 'T':
        direction = (direction + 1) % 4

# Check if the robot reaches the target position
if position[0] == x and position[1] == y:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

This solution uses a direction variable to keep track of the current direction the robot is facing, and a position variable to keep track of the robot's position on the 2D plane. The direction variable is an integer that can take on four possible values: 0 (right), 1 (up), 2 (left), and 3 (down). The position variable is a list of two integers, representing the x and y coordinates of the robot's position.

The solution simulates the robot's movement by iterating through the instruction sequence s. For each instruction, it updates the robot's direction and position accordingly. If the instruction is 'F', it increments or decrements the robot's position in the current direction, depending on whether the direction is right or left. If the instruction is 'T', it increments the direction variable by 1, and takes the modulo 4 of the result to ensure that the direction variable remains in the range [0, 3].

After simulating the robot's movement, the solution checks if the robot reaches the target position specified in the input. If the robot's position matches the target position, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
