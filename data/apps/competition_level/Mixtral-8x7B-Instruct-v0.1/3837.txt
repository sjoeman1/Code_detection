 Here is a possible solution using Python 3:

```python
import heapq

def min_days(n, m, s, a, b, c):
    # Sort the bugs in decreasing order of complexity
    a.sort(reverse=True)

    # Create a heap to store the students in increasing order of their ability levels
    min_heap = [(b[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)

    # Initialize the number of passes given to the students
    passes_given = 0

    # Initialize the result list with -1 for each bug
    result = [-1] * m

    # Iterate over the bugs
    for i in range(m):
        # If the heap is empty, we cannot fix the current bug
        if not min_heap:
            return "NO"

        # Get the student with the minimum ability level from the heap
        _, student = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # If the student's ability level is less than the bug's complexity
        if b[student] < a[i]:
            # Add the bug's complexity to the heap
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (b[student], student))
            # If the heap is not empty, continue to the next bug
            if min_heap:
                continue
            else:
                return "NO"

        # Fix the current bug by the student
        result[i] = student + 1

        # Add the student's pass requirement to the total passes given
        passes_given += c[student]

        # If the total passes given exceeds the limit, return "NO"
        if passes_given > s:
            return "NO"

    return "YES\n" + " ".join(map(str, result))

# Read the input
n, m, s = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Call the function and print the result
print(min
