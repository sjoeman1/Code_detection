 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import sys
from math import floor

def can_takahashi_move(a, k):
    return any(1 <= x % k < a[x] for x in range(n))

def simulate(a, k):
    while can_takahashi_move(a, k):
        b = [(x - min(x, a[x] // k) + k - 1) // k * k for x in range(n)]
        a = [x - b[x] for x in range(n)]
    return 'Aoki' if sum(a) == 0 else 'Takahashi'

input()
a, k = [], []
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a.append(x)
    k.append(y)
print(simulate(a, k))
```

The solution uses dynamic programming to simulate the game. At each step, we check if Takahashi can make a move. If so, we calculate the new state of the piles after Takahashi's move, and repeat the process. If not, it means that Takahashi has lost the game, and Aoki wins.

The function `can_takahashi_move` checks if Takahashi can make a move. It returns `True` if there exists a pile with at least one stone, and such that the number of stones in the pile is not a multiple of `k[i]`, or it is a multiple of `k[i]` and is strictly greater than `a[i]`.

The function `simulate` simulates the game. It takes as input the piles of stones `a` and the associated integers `k`, and returns the winner of the game. It does so by repeatedly applying `can_takahashi_move` and updating the state of the piles until Takahashi can no longer make a move. At that point, it checks if all the piles are empty. If so, it means that Aoki has won the game, and the function returns `'Aoki'`. Otherwise, it means that Takahashi has won the game, and the
