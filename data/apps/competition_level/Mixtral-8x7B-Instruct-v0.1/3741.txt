 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

input = sys.stdin.readline

def bitwise_and_cycle(n: int, a: list) -> int:
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] & a[j] != 0:
                graph[i].append(j)
                graph[j].append(i)

    visited = [False] * n
    length = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            length = max(length, dfs(graph, visited, i, i, -1))

    return length if length != -1 else -1

def dfs(graph: dict, visited: list, node: int, parent: int, prev_length: int) -> int:
    visited[node] = True
    length = prev_length + 1

    for child in graph[node]:
        if not visited[child]:
            length = max(length, dfs(graph, visited, child, node, length))
        elif child != parent:
            length = max(length, prev_length + 1)

    return length

n = int(input().strip())
a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

print(bitwise_and_cycle(n, a))
```
The solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. It first constructs a graph using the bitwise AND operation and then performs DFS on each connected component. If a cycle is found, it updates the length of the shortest cycle. Finally, it returns the length of the shortest cycle found or -1 if no cycle is found.
