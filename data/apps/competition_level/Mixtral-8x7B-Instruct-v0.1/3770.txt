 Here is a Python3 solution using NetworkX library to create and manipulate the graph. The idea is to calculate the sum of B\_i for all connected components before and after deleting each vertex, and keep track of the maximum profit.

```python
import networkx as nx

def max\_profit():
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
edges = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

G = nx.Graph()
for u, v in edges:
G.add\_edge(u, v)

total\_cost = sum(a)
max\_profit = -total\_cost # initialize with the minimum possible value

# iterate over all vertices
for v in range(1, n+1):
G\_v = G.copy() # create a copy of the graph
G\_v.remove\_node(v) # delete vertex v

# calculate the sum of B\_i for all connected components
scores = [sum(b[cc] for cc in c) for c in nx.connected\_components(G\_v)]

# calculate the profit
profit = sum(abs(s) for s in scores) - a[v-1]

# update the maximum profit
max\_profit = max(max\_profit, profit)

print(max\_profit)

if **name** == '**main**':
max\_profit()
```

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(N \* (N + M)) due to the use of NetworkX library, which may not be efficient enough for larger inputs. A more efficient solution would be to use a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of connected components, which would reduce the time complexity to O(N \* log(N) + M \* log(N)).
