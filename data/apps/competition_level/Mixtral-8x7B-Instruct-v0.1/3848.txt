 Here's a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def is\_palindrome(s):
s = s.lower()
return s == s[::-1]

def find\_next\_tolerable(n, p, s):
s = list(s)
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
if s[i] < "a" + p or not is\_palindrome(s[i:]):
break
s[i] = chr(ord(s[i]) + 1)
for j in range(i + 1, n):
s[j] = "a"
if is\_palindrome("".join(s[i:j + 1])):
s[j - 1] = chr(ord(s[j - 1]) + 1)
for j in range(j - 1, i, -1):
s[j] = s[j - 1]
s[i] = chr(ord(s[i]) + 1)
return "".join(s) if all(ord(c) <= ord("a") + p for c in s) else "NO"

n, p = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
print(find\_next\_tolerable(n, p, s))
```

The solution first checks if the given string is a palindrome or not. If it is a palindrome, it increments the last character that is not a palindrome. If the string is not a palindrome, it finds the largest substring that is a palindrome and increments the previous character of that substring. If there is no such character to increment, it increments the first character of the string.

The function `find_next_tolerable` takes three arguments - `n`, `p`, and `s`. It first converts the string `s` to a list of characters. It then iterates through the characters of the string from right to left, checking if the character is a palindrome or not. If the character is not a palindrome, it breaks out of the loop. If the character is a palindrome, it increments the character and returns the updated string.
