 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min\_extensions(a, b, h, w, extensions):
n = len(extensions)
dp = [[-1 for _ in range(b+1)] for _ in range(h+1)]
for i in range(h+1):
for j in range(b+1):
if i == 0 and j == 0:
dp[i][j] = 0
elif i == 0:
dp[i][j] = float('inf')
elif j == 0:
dp[i][j] = float('inf')
else:
if dp[i][j] == -1:
dp[i][j] = float('inf')
else:
for k in range(n):
if i >= a*extensions[k]:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-a*extensions[k]][j] + 1)
if j >= b*extensions[k]:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-b*extensions[k]] + 1)
return dp[h][w]

T = int(input())
for t in range(T):
a, b, h, w, n = map(int, input().split())
extensions = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = min\_extensions(a, b, h, w, extensions)
print(ans)
```

The solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of extensions needed to enlarge the field to a size of at least `a x b`. The `dp` array is a 2D array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of extensions needed to enlarge the field to a size of at least `i x j`. The solution iterates over all possible values of `i` and `j` and updates the `dp` array accordingly. If the current value of `i` or `j` is 0, then the minimum number of extensions needed is infinity. Otherwise, the solution checks all available extensions and updates the `dp` array with the minimum number of extensions needed to enlarge the field to a size of at least `i x j`. Finally,
