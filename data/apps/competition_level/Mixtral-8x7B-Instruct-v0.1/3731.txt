 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min\_possible\_letters(a, b, l, r):
a -= 1
b -= 1

# Create a list to store the number of occurrences of each letter
count = [0] \* 26

# Initialize the first a letters
for i in range(a):
count[ord(chr(i + ord('a')))] = 1

# Calculate the number of times each letter is added by Mister B
add\_b = [0] \* 26
for i in range(b):
add\_b[ord(chr(i + ord('a')))] += 1

# Calculate the number of times each letter is added by the opponent
add\_a = [0] \* 26
for i in range(a):
add\_a[ord(chr(i + ord('a')))] += 1

# Calculate the minimum number of different letters in the segment
res = a
for i in range(l - 1, r):
last = (i - 1) % a
cur = i % a

# Add the number of occurrences of the current letter by Mister B
count[ord(chr(cur + ord('a')))] += add\_b[ord(chr(cur + ord('a')))]

# Subtract the number of occurrences of the current letter by the opponent
count[ord(chr(last + ord('a')))] -= add\_a[ord(chr(last + ord('a')))]

# Update the minimum number of different letters
res = min(res, sum(count))

return res
```

The function `min_possible_letters` takes four integers `a`, `b`, `l`, and `r` as input and returns the minimum possible number of different letters in the segment from position `l` to position `r`, inclusive, in string `s`.

The function first calculates the number of occurrences of each letter in the first `a` letters of the string. Then, it calculates the number of times each letter is added by Mister B and his opponent on each turn.

Finally, the function iterates over the segment from
