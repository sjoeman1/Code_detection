 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def max\_phone\_numbers(n, digits):
    # Count the number of '8's in the string
    eight\_count = digits.count('8')

    # Return 0 if there are no '8's
    if eight\_count == 0:
        return 0

    # Calculate the number of phone numbers that can be made
    #
