 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def power(x, n, mod):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2:
            result = (result * x) % mod
            n -= 1
        else:
            x = (x * x) % mod
            n //= 2
    return result % mod

def solve(N, K, mod):
    if N == 1:
        return K
    if N % 2 == 0:
        half = N // 2
        return (power(K, half, mod) * (K + 1)) % mod
    else:
        half = (N - 1) // 2
        return (power(K, half, mod) * (K + 1) - power(K, half + 1, mod) + mod) % mod

N, K = map(int, input().split())
print(solve(N, K, 1000000007))
```

The solution uses the following observations:

1. The number of palindromes of length `N` that can be formed with numbers from `1` to `K` is equal to the number of ways to choose the first half of the palindrome, multiplied by `(K + 1)`.
2. If `N` is odd, then the middle element can be any number from `1` to `K`, and the number of ways to choose the first half of the palindrome is equal to the number of palindromes of length `(N - 1) / 2` that can be formed with numbers from `1` to `K`.
3. If `N` is even, then the middle two elements must be the same, and the number of ways to choose the first half of the palindrome is equal to the number of palindromes of length `N / 2 - 1` that can be formed with numbers from `1` to `K`.
4. To compute the result modulo `10^9+7`, we use the modular exponentiation technique to compute `K^(N/2)
