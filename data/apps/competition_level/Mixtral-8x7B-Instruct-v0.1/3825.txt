 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def solve(n):
    # Memoization table to store the results of subproblems
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)

    # Base case: only one digit is allowed
    dp[1] = 4

    # Iterate over the number of digits
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Initialize current result with 0
        curr = 0

        # Try all four possible digits
        for j in range(1, 5):
            # If the current digit is
