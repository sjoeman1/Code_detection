 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the result with the number of pairs of adjacent bulbs
# with different parity in the given garland
result = sum(p[i] % 2 != p[i-1] % 2 for i in range(1, n) if p[i-1] != 0 and p[i] != 0)

# Try to place the removed bulbs in the positions with the same parity
# as the previous bulb
for i in range(n):
    if p[i] == 0:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # If the current position has even index, then look for
            # the nearest removed bulb on the left
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and p[j] == 0:
                j -= 1
            if j >= 0 and p[j] % 2 == 0:
                # If the nearest removed bulb on the left has the same
                # parity as the previous bulb, then place it in the
                # current position
                p[i] = p[j]
                p[j] = 0
                if i < n - 1 and p[i] % 2 != p[i+1] % 2:
                    # If the complexity changes, then update the result
                    result -= 1
        else:
            # If the current position has odd index, then look for
            # the nearest removed bulb on the right
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and p[j] == 0:
                j += 1
            if j < n and p[j] % 2 == 1:
                # If the nearest removed bulb on the right has the same
                # parity as the previous bulb, then place it in the
                # current position
                p[i] = p[j]
                p[j] = 0
                if i >= 1 and p[i] % 2 != p[i-1]
