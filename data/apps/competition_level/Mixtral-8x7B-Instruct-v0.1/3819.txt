 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min_operations(n, a, b):
    # Initialize the pile and hand with empty cards
    pile = [0] * n
    hand = [0] * n
    # Initialize the top of the pile
    top = 0
    # Initialize the count of operations
    operations = 0
    
    # Loop through the given hand
    for i in range(n):
        # While the top of the pile is less than the current card in hand
        while top < a[i]:
            # If the pile is empty, add a numbered card
            if pile[top] == 0:
                top += 1
                pile[top] = top
            # Otherwise, play the top card of the pile
            else:
                top_card = pile[top]
                pile[top] = 0
                pile[n] = top_card
                top += 1
                operations += 1
        # Add the current card to the pile
        pile[top] = a[i]
        top += 1
        
    # Loop through the given pile from top to bottom
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        # While the top of the pile is not equal to the current card in pile
        while pile[top-1] != b[i]:
            # If the pile is empty, add a numbered card
            if pile[top] == 0:
                top += 1
                pile[top] = top
            # Otherwise, play the top card of the pile
            else:
                top_card = pile[top]
                pile[top] = 0
                pile[n] = top_card
                top += 1
                operations += 1
        # Add the current card to the pile
        pile[top] = b[i]
        top += 1
    
    # Return the number of operations
    return operations
```

The solution uses a simulation approach, where it starts by placing the numbered cards in the hand at the bottom of the pile, in increasing order. Then, it places the numbered cards
