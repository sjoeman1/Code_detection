 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min\_decks(b, g, n):
if b+g < n or n > b or n > g:
return -1

decks = 0
while b <= n and g <= n:
b -= min(n, b)
g -= min(n, g)
decks += 1
n -= 1

return decks

b = int(input())
g = int(input())
n = int(input())

result = min\_decks(b, g, n)

if result == -1:
print("No solution")
else:
print(result)
```

The function `min_decks` calculates the minimum number of decks that Vasya should take. It does so by repeatedly subtracting the minimum of `n` and the remaining number of boys or girls, until the number of boys or girls is greater than `n`. The function returns the number of decks used so far.

The input is read from standard input and the result is printed to standard output. If there is no solution, the message "No solution" is printed instead.
