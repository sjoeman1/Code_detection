```python
import sys

n, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())

if a + b - 1 < n:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(*sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: x + a - b)[:n])
```

**Explanation:**

- The key idea is to find the sum of each element with the maximum length of the increasing subsequence (A) and the maximum length of the decreasing subsequence (B).
- We need to find the elements whose sum is equal to the target sum (N) and arrange them in descending order.
- The elements whose sum is equal to N will form the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences.
- If the total number of elements whose sum is equal to N is less than the required length of the sequence, it is not possible to satisfy the conditions.

**Time Complexity:**

- The time complexity of the code is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the sequence.
- The code iterates over the sequence only once.

**Space Complexity:**

- The space complexity of the code is O(1) as the code uses a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the input.
