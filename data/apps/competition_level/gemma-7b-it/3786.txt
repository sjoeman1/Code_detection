```python
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

s = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    s += p[i] - i

print(s)
```

**Explanation:**

* The variable `n` represents the number of inflorescences.
* The list `p` stores the number of inflorescence into which the apple from the i-th inflorescence rolls down.
* The variable `s` calculates the total number of apples that can be collected from the first inflorescence.
* The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and adds the value of `p[i] - i` to `s`.
* Finally, the value of `s` is printed as the output.
