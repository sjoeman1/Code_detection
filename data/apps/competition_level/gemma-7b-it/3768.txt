```python
x, y = map(int, input().split())

if x + y < 2:
    print("Impossible")
else:
    print(str(x//y) + str(y) + str(x%y) + "A" * x//y + "B" * x%y)
```

**Explanation:**

* Read the input for the number of oranges and apples.
* If the total number of fruits is less than 2, print Impossible.
* Otherwise, calculate the number of apples and oranges that Alice and Bob will have at the end of the game.
* Create a string with the number of cards of each letter.
* Replace the segments of identical consecutive characters with the number of repetitions of the characters.
* Print the resulting string.
