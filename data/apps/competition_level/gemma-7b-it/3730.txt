```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split().strip().split()))

a.sort()
ans = 1
for i in range(n-1):
    if a[i] > a[i+1]:
        ans = max(ans, i+2)

print(ans)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Sort the sequence in ascending order.
2. Iterate over the sequence and find the first element that is greater than the previous element.
3. The length of the subsegment is the number of elements between the current element and the previous element.
4. Update the maximum length of the subsegment if necessary.
5. Print the maximum length of the subsegment.
