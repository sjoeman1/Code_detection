```python
n = int(input())
s = input()

# Create a dictionary to store the number of distinct strings for each prefix
distinct_strings = {}

# Iterate over the string to find the number of distinct strings for each prefix
for i in range(n):
    prefix = s[:i+1]
    if prefix not in distinct_strings:
        distinct_strings[prefix] = 1
    else:
        distinct_strings[prefix] += 1

# Calculate the total number of distinct strings
total_distinct_strings = sum(distinct_strings.values())

# Print the number of distinct strings modulo (10^9+7)
print(total_distinct_strings % (10**9 + 7))
```

**Explanation:**

- The code iterates over the string S and creates a dictionary to store the number of distinct strings for each prefix.
- The key of the dictionary is the prefix, and the value is the number of distinct strings for that prefix.
- The code calculates the total number of distinct strings by summing the values in the dictionary.
- The total number of distinct strings is then printed modulo (10^9+7).

**Time complexity:**

- The code iterates over the string S only once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

**Space complexity:**

- The code uses a dictionary to store the number of distinct strings for each prefix, so the space complexity is O(n).
