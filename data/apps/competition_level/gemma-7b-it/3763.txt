```python
import math

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
p = int(input())

s = sum(a)
if s <= p:
    print(len(a))
else:
    print(math.floor(s/p))
```

**Explanation:**

* Read the number of guests, their sizes, and the table's length.
* Calculate the total sum of guests' sizes.
* If the total sum is less than or equal to the table's length, print the number of guests.
* Otherwise, print the integer division of the total sum by the table's length.
