```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()
t = input()

# Calculate the number of strings that are prefixes of at least one of the written strings
c = 0
for i in range(len(s) + 1):
    prefix_s = s[:i]
    if prefix_s in t or prefix_s == s:
        c += 1

# Print the maximum value of c
print(c)
```
