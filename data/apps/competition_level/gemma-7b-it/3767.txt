```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

a_sum = sum(a)
b_sum = sum(b)
k = 0
t = 0

for i in range(n):
    k_i = a[i] // b[i]
    t_i = a[i] % b[i]
    k += k_i
    t += t_i

print(k, t)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code calculates the total amount of soda (a_sum) and the total volume of the bottles (b_sum).
* It then iterates over the bottles and calculates the number of units of soda that can be stored in each bottle (k_i).
* The code updates the total number of bottles (k) and the total time (t) required to store the soda.
* The time (t) is calculated by taking the remainder (t_i) when the number of units of soda to be stored (a[i]) is divided by the volume of the bottle (b[i]) and multiplying it by the time spent pouring units of soda from one bottle to another (1).
* Finally, the code prints the number of bottles (k) and the time (t) required to store the soda.
