```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = prod = 1
for i in a:
    prod *= i
    m = m // i

print(len(set(tuple(factor(m)))/n)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of test cases (n) and then reads the n integers of the product (a).
* It calculates the product of the integers (m) and finds all the factors of m.
* It creates a set of tuples, each tuple containing the factors of m and the number of occurrences of each factor in the product.
* The code then divides the number of distinct decompositions by n to find the number of distinct decompositions of number m into n ordered multipliers.
* Finally, the number of distinct decompositions is printed.
