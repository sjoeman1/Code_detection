```python
n, x = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().splitlines()))

# Calculate the XOR of two numbers
def xor(x, y):
    return (x ^ y) & 2**32 - 1

# Calculate the number of different integers not exceeding X that can be written on the blackboard
ans = 0
for i in a:
    x_double = 2 * i
    x_xor = xor(i, x_double)
    if x_xor <= x:
        ans += 1

print(ans)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the number of non-negative integers, `N`, and the value of `X`, which is the upper bound for the integers that can be written on the blackboard.
- It then reads the `N` integers, `A_i`, written on the blackboard.
- The code calculates the XOR of two numbers using the `xor` function.
- It calculates the double of each integer and XORs it with the original integer.
- If the result of the XOR operation is less than or equal to `X`, it increments the `ans` variable.
- Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
