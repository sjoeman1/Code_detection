```python
n = int(input())
crush = list(map(int, input().split()))

possible = False
t = 1
while not possible:
    for i in range(n):
        if crush[i] == i and crush[crush[i]] == i:
            for j in range(i, n):
                if crush[j] == i and crush[crush[j]] == j:
                    t += 1
                    possible = True
    if not possible:
        t = -1

print(t)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of people in Arpa's land and their crushes.
* It checks if there is a t that satisfies the condition for each person.
* If the condition is not satisfied, it prints -1.
* Otherwise, it prints the smallest t that satisfies the condition.
