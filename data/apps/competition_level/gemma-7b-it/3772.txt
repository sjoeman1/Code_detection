```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Find the number of resistors needed to make an element with resistance a/b
res = 1
while res * R_0 < b:
    res += 1

# Print the answer
print(res)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the input integers `a` and `b`.
- It calculates the number of resistors needed to make an element with resistance `a/b` using the formula `res = 1 + (b - 1) // R_0`.
- The formula calculates the number of resistors needed to make an element with resistance `a/b` as the number of resistors needed to make an element with resistance `b` minus 1, divided by `R_0`.
- The code then prints the answer.
