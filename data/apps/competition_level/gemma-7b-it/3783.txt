```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())

mod = 10**9 + 7

# Calculate the cost of having x people
cost = lambda x: x ** k

# Calculate the sum of costs over all non-empty subsets
total_cost = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    total_cost += cost(i)

# Print the total cost
print(total_cost % mod)
```
