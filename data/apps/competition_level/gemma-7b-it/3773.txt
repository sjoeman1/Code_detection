```python
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
K = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the maximum number of stones that can be removed from each pile
max_stones = []
for i in range(N):
    max_stones.append(int(A[i] // K[i]))

# Iterate over the piles and remove stones
for i in range(N):
    A[i] -= max_stones[i]

# Check if Takahashi can still remove stones
if any(A[i] > 0 for i in range(N)):
    print("Takahashi")
else:
    print("Aoki")
```

**Explanation:**

- The code calculates the maximum number of stones that can be removed from each pile based on the value of K.
- It then iterates over the piles and removes stones according to the maximum number of stones that can be removed.
- If there are still stones left in any pile, Takahashi wins. Otherwise, Aoki wins.
