```python
T = int(input())  # Number of test cases

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())  # Number of bags and dishes
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Number of coins in each bag

    # Calculate the winner of the game
    winner = "Second" if sum(a) % 2 == 0 else "First"

    # Print the winner
    print(winner)
```

**Explanation:**

- The game has two players, Taro and Jiro, and they take turns alternately.
- In each turn, a player can either move all the coins from a bag to a dish or remove coins from a dish.
- The game ends when one player is unable to make a move.
- If the total number of coins is even, Taro wins. If the total number of coins is odd, Jiro wins.
- The code calculates the total number of coins and checks if it is even or odd to determine the winner.
