```python
H, W = map(int, input().split())

a = []
for _ in range(H):
    a.append([input().strip() for _ in range(W)])

S, T = None, None
for i in range(H):
    for j in range(W):
        if a[i][j] == "S":
            S = (i, j)
        elif a[i][j] == "T":
            T = (i, j)

leaves_to_remove = 0
if S and T:
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if a[i][j] == "o" and (i, j) != S and (i, j) != T:
                leaves_to_remove += 1

    print(leaves_to_remove)
    print("Remove the following leaves:")
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if a[i][j] == "o" and (i, j) != S and (i, j) != T:
                print((i, j))
else:
    print(-1)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the input, including the number of rows and columns in the pond, and the grid of squares.
- It then finds the locations of the frog (S) and the leaf (T).
- The code calculates the number of leaves to remove, which is the number of squares with leaves (o) that are not S or T.
- If the objective is achievable, the code prints the number of leaves to remove and the squares where they should be removed.
- If the objective is not achievable, the code prints -1.
