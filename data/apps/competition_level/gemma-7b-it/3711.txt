```python
import math

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

if k > 2 * (n + m):
    print(-1)
else:
    area = n * m
    cuts = 0
    while area // k:
        cuts += 1
        area //= k
    print(area)
```

**Explanation:**

* We need to find the number of cuts that can be made to the chocolate bar.
* The maximum number of cuts that can be made is the minimum of the number of cuts that can be made to the bar in each direction (horizontal and vertical).
* The number of cuts that can be made in each direction is equal to the number of unit squares in the bar in that direction.
* We need to find the area of the smallest piece of chocolate that can be cut from the bar with the number of cuts that we have found.
* The area of the smallest piece of chocolate is equal to the number of unit squares in that piece.
* The answer is the area of the smallest piece of chocolate that can be cut from the bar with exactly k cuts.
