```python
n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

for i in range(k):
    for i in range(0, len(a), 2):
        a[i] ^= x

print(max(a), min(a))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the number of rangers, the number of operations, and Jon's favourite number.
2. Read the strengths of the rangers.
3. Sort the rangers by strength in ascending order.
4. Iterate over the rangers in steps of 2 and perform the XOR operation with Jon's favourite number.
5. Update the strengths of the rangers.
6. Print the maximum and minimum strengths of the rangers.
