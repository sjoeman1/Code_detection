```python
n = int(input())
t = list(map(int, input().split()))

t.sort()

if len(set(t)) == 3 and t[1] - t[0] <= 2 and t[2] - t[1] <= 2:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the number of balls and the list of ball sizes.
2. Sort the list of ball sizes in ascending order.
3. Check if the number of distinct ball sizes is 3.
4. Check if the difference between any two balls is less than or equal to 2.
5. If all conditions are met, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".
