```python
a, b, l, r = map(int, input().split())

s = ""

# Calculate the number of different letters in the first a letters of the string
num_different_letters = set(s[:a])

# Append b letters to the string
s += ''.join(set(s) & set(s[:a]) | set(['a' * b])

# Calculate the number of different letters in the segment from position l to position r
min_different_letters = len(set(s[l-1:r]))

print(min_different_letters)
```

**Explanation:**

* The program reads the input data: `a`, `b`, `l`, and `r`.
* It calculates the number of different letters in the first `a` letters of the string `s` using a set and `len(set())`.
* It appends `b` letters to the string `s` by creating a set of the first `a` letters and adding `b` copies of each letter to the set.
* It calculates the number of different letters in the segment from position `l` to position `r` using a set of the characters in the segment.
* Finally, the program prints the minimum number of different letters in the segment.

**Time complexity:**

* The program calculates the number of different letters in the first `a` letters of the string `s` in constant time.
* The program appends `b` letters to the string `s` in constant time.
* The program calculates the number of different letters in the segment from position `l` to position `r` in constant time.
* Overall, the program has a time complexity of O(a + b + r).

**Space complexity:**

* The program uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
