```python
n = int(input())
s = list(map(int, input().split()))

s.sort()

g = 1
for i in s:
    g = gcd(g, i)

print(len(s) - g + 1)
```

**Explanation:**

* Read the number of Pokemon and their strengths.
* Sort the strengths in ascending order.
* Find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first group of strengths.
* Subtract the gcd from the number of strengths.
* Add 1 to the result to account for the Pokemon that does not fight with itself.
* Print the result.
