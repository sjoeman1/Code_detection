```python
k, d, t = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the time spent cooking when the stove is on
time_on = t

# Calculate the time spent cooking when the stove is off
time_off = 2 * t

# Calculate the total time spent cooking
total_time = time_on + time_off

# Print the total time spent cooking
print(round(total_time, 1))
