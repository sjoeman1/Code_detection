```python
n = int(input())
print(int((n*(n-1)*(n-2)) // 6) % (10**9 + 7))
```

**Explanation:**

- The number of binary relations over a set of size n that are symmetric and transitive, but not reflexive is given by the formula: n*(n-1)*(n-2) // 6.
- This is because there are n choices for the first element, n-1 choices for the second element, and n-2 choices for the third element. The total number of pairs is therefore n*n-1*n-2.
- The number of reflexive relations is n. Therefore, the number of binary relations over a set of size n that are symmetric and transitive, but not reflexive is n*(n-1)*(n-2) // 6 - n = n*(n-1)*(n-2) // 6.
- The output is printed modulo 10^9 + 7 to ensure that the answer is within the desired range.
