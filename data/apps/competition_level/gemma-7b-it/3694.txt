```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

s = set(a)
if len(s) == 1 or not a:
    print("cslnb")
else:
    print("sjfnb")
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of piles `n` and the number of stones in each pile `a`.
* It creates a set `s` of the number of stones in each pile.
* If the number of piles is 1 or there are no stones, CSL will win.
* Otherwise, if the number of stones in two piles is the same after Tokitsukaze's move, she will lose.
