```python
k, a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a + b < k or a + b <= k:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(a // k)
```

**Explanation:**

* The maximum number of sets that can be played is equal to the number of points scored by Misha divided by k, as each set is won by one point.
* If the total number of points scored is less than or equal to k, it is impossible to play the required number of sets.
* Therefore, we check if the total number of points scored is greater than the required number of points to win a set and if it is, we print the maximum number of sets that can be played.
