```python
import random

m, n = map(int, input().split())

# Probability of each face appearing
p = [1 / m] * m

# Number of dots on each face
num_dots = range(1, m + 1)

# Calculate the expected number of dots
expectation = sum(num_dots * p) * n

# Print the expected maximum number of dots
print(round(expectation, 6))
