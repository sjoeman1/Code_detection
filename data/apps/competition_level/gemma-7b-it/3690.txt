```python
h, m, s, t_1, t_2 = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the time difference
time_diff = t_2 - t_1

# If the time difference is greater than the number of hours, it's not possible to prepare the contest on time
if time_diff > h:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
```

**Explanation:**

* The input consists of five integers: `h`, `m`, `s`, `t_1`, and `t_2`.
* `h` is the number of hours, `m` is the number of minutes, and `s` is the number of seconds.
* `t_1` is Misha's position on the clock face, and `t_2` is the target time.
* If the time difference between `t_1` and `t_2` is greater than the number of hours, it is not possible to prepare the contest on time.
* Otherwise, it is possible to prepare the contest on time.

**Time Complexity:**

* The code calculates the time difference in constant time.
* The code then checks if the time difference is greater than the number of hours in constant time.

**Space Complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
