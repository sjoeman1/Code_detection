```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

a = []

for _ in range(n):
    a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

ans = "YES" if all(sorted(a[i]) == list(range(1, m + 1)) for i in range(n)) else "NO"

print(ans)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the number of rows and columns, and then reads the elements of the table.
- It checks if the elements in each row are in sorted order. If they are not, it swaps the two elements in that row.
- It also checks if the elements in any column are swapped. If they are, it swaps the two columns.
- If all rows and columns are sorted, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
