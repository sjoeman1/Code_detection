```python
n, T = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the prefix sum and find the maximum length of the non-decreasing sequence
prefix_sum = []
length = 1
for i in range(n):
    prefix_sum.append(a[i] - i)
    for j in range(i):
        if prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] >= 0:
            length = max(length, 1 + 1)

print(length)
```

**Explanation:**

* We calculate the prefix sum of the array a to find the sum of the first i elements.
* We iterate over the array and find the maximum length of the non-decreasing sequence that can be formed from the first i elements.
* The length of the non-decreasing sequence is the maximum of the current length and 1 plus the length of the non-decreasing sequence that can be formed from the first i-1 elements.
* Finally, we print the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence.
