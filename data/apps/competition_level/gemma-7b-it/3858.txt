```python
N = int(input())
x = []
y = []
for _ in range(N):
    x.append(int(input()))
    y.append(int(input()))

# Calculate the convex hull of S
convex_hull = convex_hull(x, y)

# Count the number of points inside the convex hull
n = len(convex_hull)

# Calculate the score of S
score = 2 ** (n - len(S))

# Print the sum of all the scores modulo 998244353
print((sum(score) % 998244353)  )
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the number of points `N`, then reads the coordinates `x_i` and `y_i` for each point.
- It calculates the convex hull of the points using the `convex_hull()` function.
- The number of points inside the convex hull is counted and stored in the variable `n`.
- The score of S is calculated using the formula `2^{n-|S|}` and stored in the variable `score`.
- The sum of all the scores is calculated and printed modulo 998244353.

**Note:**

- The `convex_hull()` function is a third-party library that calculates the convex hull of a set of points.
- The code assumes that the `S` set is a subset of the `x` and `y` lists.
- The modulo operation is used to ensure that the sum of all the scores does not exceed the limit.
