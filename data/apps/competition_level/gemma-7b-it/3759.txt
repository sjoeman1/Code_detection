```python
n = int(input())
m = int((n + 1) ** 2)
g = 0
for i in range(m):
    g += i + 1

print(g)
```

**Explanation:**

The key to solving this problem is to understand that the number of special points that are 4-connected to a point at a distance of r is equal to r. Therefore, to prevent a point at a distance of r from being 4-connected to a non-special point, we need to block all points at a distance of r or less.

The formula to calculate the number of special points that are 4-connected to a point at a distance of r is given by the formula: g = r(r+1) / 2.

Once we have calculated the total number of points to block, we can simply print that number.
