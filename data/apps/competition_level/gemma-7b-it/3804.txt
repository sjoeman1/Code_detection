```python
n, t = map(int, input().split())

m = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    if t - i * (i - 1) // 2 <= 0:
        m += 1

print(m)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads two integers, `n` and `t`, representing the number of rows and the target sum, respectively.
* It iterates over the range `1` to `n + 1`, calculating the sum of the first `i` rows and checking if it is equal to `t - i * (i - 1) // 2`.
* If the sum is equal, it increments the variable `m`.
* Finally, the code prints the value of `m`.

**Time Complexity:**

* The code iterates over the range `1` to `n + 1` only once, so the time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size, so the space complexity is O(1).
