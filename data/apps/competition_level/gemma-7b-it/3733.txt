```python
n, I = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the number of distinct values
K = len(set(a))

# Calculate the number of bits needed to store each value
k = int((K-1).log2()) + 1

# Calculate the number of changed elements
c = min(n, k) - len(set(a))

print(c)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input data: $n$ (length of the array), $I$ (size of the disk in bytes), and the array $a$.
* It calculates the number of distinct values $K$ in the array.
* It calculates the number of bits needed to store each value $k$.
* It calculates the number of changed elements $c$ as the minimum of $n$ and $k$, minus the length of the set of elements in $a$.
* Finally, the code prints the number of changed elements.

**Time complexity:**

* The code reads the input data in constant time.
* The code calculates the number of distinct values in linear time.
* The code calculates the number of bits needed to store each value in logarithmic time.
* The code calculates the number of changed elements in linear time.

**Space complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space.
