```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

c.sort()
mod = c[0]

if k in c:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the number of ancient integers `n` and the value of `k` chosen by Pari.
2. Read the `n` ancient numbers and store them in the list `c`.
3. Sort the list `c` in ascending order.
4. Now the first element in `c` is the modulo of all numbers. If `k` is in `c`, then Arya has a winning strategy, otherwise not.

**Time Complexity:**

* Reading input: O(n)
* Sorting the list: O(n)
* Checking if `k` is in the list: O(n)

**Space Complexity:**

* Constant space

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: Constant
