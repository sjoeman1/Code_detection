```python
n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

x = 0
y = float('inf')
for i in range(k-1):
    x = max(x, a[i])
    y = min(y, a[i])

print(x-y)
```

**Explanation:**

* We need to find the contiguous subsequence of length K that has the smallest element.
* We store the first K-1 elements in the list `a` and sort them in ascending order.
* The largest element removed is the maximum element in the sorted list, and the smallest element removed is the minimum element in the sorted list.
* The difference between the largest and smallest elements is the answer.
