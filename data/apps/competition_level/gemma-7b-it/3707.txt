```python
n, t, k, d = map(int, input().split())

if (n - 1) * t <= k * t:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

**Explanation:**

* The time needed to bake n cakes is equal to (n - 1) * t minutes.
* The time needed to bake k cakes with one oven is k * t minutes.
* If (n - 1) * t is less than or equal to k * t, then it is reasonable to build the second oven. Otherwise, it is not.

**Time complexity:**

* The time complexity of this code is O(1), as it reads and processes the input in constant time.

**Space complexity:**

* The space complexity of this code is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
