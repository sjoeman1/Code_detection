```python
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split().strip().split()))

p.sort()
g = 0
for i in range(n):
    if p[i] != 0 and p[i-1] != 0 and p[i] != p[i-1]:
        g += 1

print(g)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Sort the list `p` in ascending order.
2. Iterate over the list `p` and check if the current bulb is not 0 and the previous bulb is not 0 and different from the current bulb. If both conditions are met, increment `g` by 1.
3. Finally, print `g`.
