```python
s = input().lower()
a = set(s.split())
n = len(a)
if n <= 26:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

**Explanation:**

- The program reads the input string `s` which represents the identifiers of the program.
- It creates a set `a` of unique identifiers in the string.
- If the number of unique identifiers in the set `a` is less than or equal to 26, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Time Complexity:**

- The program reads the input string only once, so the time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the length of the input string.

**Space Complexity:**

- The program uses a set `a` of size at most 26, so the space complexity is O(n) where `n` is the number of unique identifiers in the input string.
