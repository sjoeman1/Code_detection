```python
import numpy as np

a_x, a_y, b_x, b_y, t_x, t_y = map(int, input().split())
n = int(input())

x_i, y_i = np.array(map(int, input().split())).reshape(n, 2)

# Calculate the distance between Adil/Bera and each bottle
distance = np.sqrt((x_i - a_x)**2 + (y_i - a_y)**2) + np.sqrt((x_i - b_x)**2 + (y_i - b_y)**2)

# Find the minimum distance
min_distance = np.sum(np.min(distance, axis=0))

print(min_distance)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input data, including the positions of Adil, Bera, the recycling bin, and the number of bottles.
* It calculates the distance between Adil/Bera and each bottle using the square root of the sum of squares of the difference in x and y coordinates.
* The code finds the minimum distance by taking the minimum of the distances for each bottle and summing them.
* The total distance is printed as the output.
