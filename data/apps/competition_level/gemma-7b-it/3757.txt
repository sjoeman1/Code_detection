```python
a_00, a_01, a_10, a_11 = map(int, input().split())

if a_00 + a_01 + a_10 + a_11 == 0:
    print("Impossible")
else:
    s = ""
    # Calculate the number of 0s and 1s in the string
    a_0 = min(a_00, a_01)
    a_1 = min(a_10, a_11)
    a_00 -= a_0
    a_01 -= a_0
    a_10 -= a_1
    a_11 -= a_1

    # Construct the string
    for i in range(a_0):
        s += "0"
    for i in range(a_1):
        s += "1"

    # Print the answer
    print(s)
```

**Explanation:**

- The algorithm calculates the number of 0s and 1s required for the string based on the input integers.
- It then constructs the string by allocating the maximum number of 0s followed by the maximum number of 1s.
- The remaining number of 0s and 1s are added to the end of the string.
- If the total number of 0s and 1s in the string is not equal to the input integers, it prints "Impossible".
