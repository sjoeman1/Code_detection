{"problem_id": 0, "question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.\n\nFor example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. \n\nYou are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it.

It uses the `match()` method to see if the string matches the regular expression for an accordion.\n* If `s` is not an accordion, it prints -1.\n* Otherwise, it calculates the length of the shortest possible accordion by subtracting the number of closing brackets and opening brackets from the length of `s`.\n* The code then prints the maximum length of the result."}

{"problem_id": 8, "question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\\ldots$, 9s.\n\nIn order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\n\nDo you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?\n\nHere are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. \n\nSome examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] \u2014 it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] \u2014 it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] \u2014 it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. \n\nNote that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three strings\u00a0\u2014 the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.

The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.\n\nHelp him to check the correctness of his records.\n\nFor your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \\le T \\le 500)$ \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \\le p_i, c_i \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.\n\nNote that the stats are given in chronological order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single line.\n\nIf there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print \"YES\".\n\nOtherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2\n1 0\n1000 3\n4\n10 1\n15 2\n10 2\n15 2\n1\n765 432\n2\n4 4\n4 3\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.\n\nThe second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.\n\nIn the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.\n\nThe fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.\n\nIn the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.\n\nNobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.", "gold_completion": "import sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    lastP = 0\n    lastC = 0\n    works = True\n    for _ in range(n):\n        p, c = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        pDiff = p-lastP\n        cDiff = c-lastC\n        if 0 <= cDiff <= pDiff:\n            pass\n        else:\n            works = False\n        lastP = p\n        lastC = c\n    if works:\n        print('YES')\n    else:\n        print('NO')\n", "gen_completion": "```python\nT = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    p = []\n    c = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        p.append(int(input()))\n        c.append(int(input()))\n\n    flag = True\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if p[i] > p[i+1] or c[i] < c[i+1]:\n            flag = False\n\n    print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case reads the number of moments of time and the number of plays and clears at each moment of time.\n\nIt then checks if there is a sequence of plays and clears that matches the given stats.\n\nIf there is, it prints \"YES\".

Analyze the information:**\n- Read the number of participants (n) and their ratings before and after the round (a_i and b_i).\n- Check if there is any change in ratings. If there is, the round is rated.\n- If the round is rated, check if the participant with lower rating took a better place than the participant with higher rating.

{"problem_id": 52, "question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Daniel is organizing a football tournament. He has come up with the following tournament format:   In the first several (possibly zero) stages, while the number of teams is even, they split in pairs and play one game for each pair. At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are x teams, there will be $\\frac{x \\cdot(x - 1)}{2}$ games), and the tournament ends. \n\nFor example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament. In total there would be 10+5+10=25 games.\n\nDaniel has already booked the stadium for n games. Help him to determine how many teams he should invite so that the tournament needs exactly n games.

Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.\n\nHelp Vasya!

The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one.

Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.\n\nJATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_1<a_2<\\dots<a_n \\le 10^3$)\u00a0\u2014 the array written by Giraffe.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.\n\nIf it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n1 3 4 5 6 9\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n3\n998 999 1000\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \\_, \\_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.\n\nIn the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \\_, \\_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.\n\nIn the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements.

The chessboard you are given is not necesserily $8 \\times 8$, but it still is $N \\times N$. Each square has some number written on it, all the numbers are from $1$ to $N^2$ and all the numbers are pairwise distinct. The $j$-th square in the $i$-th row has a number $A_{ij}$ written on it.\n\nIn your chess set you have only three pieces: a knight, a bishop and a rook. At first, you put one of them on the square with the number $1$ (you can choose which one). Then you want to reach square $2$ (possibly passing through some other squares in process), then square $3$ and so on until you reach square $N^2$. In one step you are allowed to either make a valid move with the current piece or replace it with some other piece. Each square can be visited arbitrary number of times.\n\nA knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. A bishop moves diagonally. A rook moves horizontally or vertically. The move should be performed to a different square from the one a piece is currently standing on.\n\nYou want to minimize the number of steps of the whole traversal.

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop.

All of them are for different people, so they are pairwise distinct (consider that the names of $m$ friends are written on the boxes). For example, putting the first kind of present into the first box but not into the second box, is different from putting the first kind of present into the second box but not into the first box.\n\nAlice wants to pack presents with the following rules:  She won't pack more than one present of each kind into the same box, so each box should contain presents of different kinds (i.e. each box contains a subset of $n$ kinds, empty boxes are allowed);  For each kind at least one present should be packed into some box. \n\nNow Alice wants to know how many different ways to pack the presents exists.

{"problem_id": 137, "question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Kuro has recently won the \"Most intelligent cat ever\" contest. The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\n\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro.

Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $[1; m]$, even if it's not required.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 80$ and $n \\le m \\le 100\\ 000$).\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \\le x_i \\le m$ and $0 \\le s_i \\le m$).\n\nOn each position, there is at most one antenna (values $x_i$ are pairwise distinct).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nYou have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 595\n43 2\n300 4\n554 10\n\nOutput\n281\n\nInput\n1 1\n1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n2 50\n20 0\n3 1\n\nOutput\n30\n\nInput\n5 240\n13 0\n50 25\n60 5\n155 70\n165 70\n\nOutput\n26\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, here is a possible strategy:\n\n  Increase the scope of the first antenna by $40$, so that it becomes $2 + 40 = 42$. This antenna will cover interval $[43 - 42; 43 + 42]$ which is $[1; 85]$  Increase the scope of the second antenna by $210$, so that it becomes $4 + 210 = 214$. This antenna will cover interval $[300 - 214; 300 + 214]$, which is $[86; 514]$  Increase the scope of the third antenna by $31$, so that it becomes $10 + 31 = 41$. This antenna will cover interval $[554 - 41; 554 + 41]$, which is $[513; 595]$ \n\nTotal cost is $40 + 210 + 31 = 281$. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from $1$ to $595$ covered by at least one antenna.\n\nNote that positions $513$ and $514$ are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.\n\n\u2014\n\nIn the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval $[0; 2]$ so we have nothing to do.\n\nNote that the only position that we needed to cover was position $1$; positions $0$ and $2$ are covered, but it's not important.", "gold_completion": "n, m, l = list(map(int,input().split(' '))) + [[]]\nfor i in range(n):l.append(list(map(int,input().split(' '))))\ndp = [0] + [m for i in range(m)]\nfor i in range(1,m+1):\n    dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 1,dp[i])\n    for j in l:\n        x = max(0,j[0] - j[1] - i)\n        y = min(m,j[0] + j[1] + x)\n        dp[y] = min(dp[y],dp[i - 1] + x)\nprint(dp[-1])", "gen_completion": "```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nx, s = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    x.append(int(input()))\n    s.append(int(input()))\n\n# Calculate the minimum coins needed\ncoins = float('inf')\nfor i in range(n):\n    l = x[i] - s[i]\n    r = x[i] + s[i]\n    coins = min(coins, abs(l) + abs(r) - 1)\n\nprint(int(coins))\n```"}

For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n#G#T#\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n6 1\nT....G\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n7 3\nT..#..G\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n6 2\n..GT..\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free\u00a0\u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times.\n\nIn the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.", "gold_completion": "import math\n\ndef solve(n, k, s):\n    i, j = s.index('G'), s.index('T')\n    if (i - j) % k != 0:\n        return False\n    for k in range(i, j, (k if i < j else -k)):\n        if k >= n or k < 0 or s[k] == '#':\n            return False\n    return True\n\nn, k = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\ns = input()\nprint('YES' if solve(n, k, s) else 'NO')\n    \n", "gen_completion": "```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\ns = input().strip()\n\ng, t = s.find('G'), s.find('T')\n\nif (g-t) % k == 0 and s[g-k] == '.':\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n```"}
{"problem_id": 164, "question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).

People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise.
