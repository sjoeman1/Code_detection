Here is the Python3 code to solve the question:

```
from math import gcd
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    if gcd(a[i], a[i+1]) != 1:
        k += 1
        a.insert(i+1, 1)
print(k)
for i in range(n+k):
    print(a[i], end=" ")
```

In this code, we first read the number of elements in the array n and then the elements of the array a. Then, we initialize k to 0. We iterate through the array and check if the GCD of any two adjacent elements is not 1. If it is not 1, then we increase k by 1 and insert 1 at the next index of the array. Finally, we print k and the new array.
