This is a tricky problem that requires some creative thinking. Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
# Input
n, L = map(int, input().split())

# Input for Kefa
kefa = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Input for Sasha
sasha = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Check if Kefa's and Sasha's tracks coincide
flag = False

# Loop through all possible starting points for Kefa and Sasha
for i in range(n):
    # Check if the tracks coincide when Kefa starts from i and Sasha starts from 0
    if kefa[i:] + kefa[:i] == sasha:
        flag = True
        break

# Print the output
if flag:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This code works by checking if the tracks coincide when Kefa starts from different starting points and Sasha starts from 0. If they coincide, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
