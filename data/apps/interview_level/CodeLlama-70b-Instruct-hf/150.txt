The Python 3 code for solving this question is as follows:

```python
def min_divisor(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2
    else:
        return n // 2 + 1

def min_taxes(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return min(min_divisor(n), min(min_taxes(n-1) + 1, min_taxes(n-2) + 2))

n = int(input())
print(min_taxes(n))
```

In this code:

*   The `min_divisor` function calculates the minimum divisor of a number.
*   The `min_taxes` function recursively calculates the minimum taxes that can be paid for a given number n.
*   The input n is read from the user.
*   The `min_taxes` function is called with n as the argument, and the result is printed.

The `min_taxes` function works as follows:

*   If n is 1, the minimum taxes are 1.
*   Otherwise, it calculates the minimum taxes using the following formula:

    *   The minimum taxes are equal to the minimum of the following:

        *   The minimum divisor of n.
        *   The minimum of the following:

            *   The minimum taxes for (n-1) + 1.
            *   The minimum taxes for (n-2) + 2.

This formula is based on the fact that the minimum taxes for n can be calculated as the minimum of the following:

*   The minimum divisor of n.
*   The minimum taxes for (n-1) + 1 (i.e., the minimum taxes for (n-1) plus the tax for 1).
*   The minimum taxes for (n-2) + 2 (i.e., the minimum taxes for (n-2) plus the tax for 2).

This formula is used recursively to calculate the minimum taxes for n.
