The following Python 3 code solves the question:

```python
# Read the input number of games
n = int(input())

# Check if the number of games is valid
if n < 1 or n > (10**18):
    print(-1)
else:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the possible number of teams
    team_list = []

    # Iterate through all possible number of teams from 1 to 10^18
    for teams in range(1, 10**18 + 1):
        # Initialize a variable to store the number of games played
        games_played = 0

        # Run the tournament simulation
        while teams > 1:
            # If the number of teams is even, simulate pairwise games
            if teams % 2 == 0:
                games_played += teams // 2
                teams //= 2
            # If the number of teams is odd, simulate a round-robin tournament
            else:
                games_played += teams * (teams - 1) // 2
                break

        # Check if the total number of games played is equal to the input
        if games_played == n:
            team_list.append(teams)

    # Check if any possible number of teams was found
    if len(team_list) > 0:
        # Sort the list in ascending order
        team_list.sort()

        # Print each possible number of teams
        for teams in team_list:
            print(teams)
    else:
        # If no possible number of teams was found, print -1
        print(-1)
```

This code first reads the input number of games (n). It then checks if the number is valid (between 1 and 10^18). If the number is valid, it initializes an empty list to store the possible number of teams. It then iterates through all possible number of teams from 1 to 10^18. For each number of teams, it initializes a variable to store the number of games played and simulates the tournament. If the number of teams is even, it simulates pairwise games. If the number of teams is
