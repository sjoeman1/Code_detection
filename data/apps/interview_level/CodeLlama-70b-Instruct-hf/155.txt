The Python code for the question is as follows:

```python
def solve(n, m, k):
    # The initial position of Lara is (1, 1)
    row = 1
    col = 1

    # Move Lara down n - 1 times
    for i in range(n - 1):
        row += 1
        k -= 1

    # Move Lara in the snake pattern
    while k > 0:
        # Move right m - 2 times
        for i in range(m - 2):
            col += 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return row, col

        # Move up n - 2 times
        for i in range(n - 2):
            row -= 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return row, col

        # Move left m - 2 times
        for i in range(m - 2):
            col -= 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return row, col

        # Move down n - 2 times
        for i in range(n - 2):
            row += 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return row, col


# Read input from stdin
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the position of Lara
row, col = solve(n, m, k)

# Print the result
print(row, col)
```

The code first reads the input (n, m, and k) from stdin, and then calculates the position of Lara using the `solve` function. The `solve` function moves Lara through the matrix using the specified pattern, and returns her position when k steps are completed. The result is then printed to stdout.
