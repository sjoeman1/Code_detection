```py
#!/usr/bin/python3

n = int(input())

# calculate the number of work days in a year
work_days = n * 5 // 7

# calculate the minimum number of days off
min_days_off = n - work_days

# calculate the maximum number of days off
max_days_off = n - (n - min_days_off) // 7 - 1

print(min_days_off, max_days_off)
```

In this Python3 code, we first take the input 'n' which represents the number of days in a year on Mars. Then, we calculate the number of work days in a year using the formula (n * 5) // 7. Then, we calculate the minimum number of days off using the formula n - work_days. Finally, we calculate the maximum number of days off using the formula n - (n - min_days_off) // 7 - 1. We print the minimum and maximum number of days off as the output.
