Here is the Python 3 code for solving the question:

```python
# Input the number of test cases
T = int(input())

# Iterate through the test cases
for _ in range(T):
    # Input the number of moments
    n = int(input())

    # Initialize the number of plays and clears
    plays = 0
    clears = 0

    # Initialize the correctness flag
    correct = True

    # Iterate through the moments
    for _ in range(n):
        # Input the current number of plays and clears
        current_plays, current_clears = map(int, input().split())

        # Check if the current number of plays is correct
        if current_plays != plays:
            correct = False
            break

        # Check if the current number of clears is correct
        if current_clears != clears:
            correct = False
            break

        # Update the number of plays and clears
        plays += 1
        if current_clears == plays:
            clears += 1

    # Check if the correctness flag is True
    if correct:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

In this code, we iterate through the test cases. For each test case, we initialize the number of plays and clears to 0. We also initialize a correctness flag to True.

Then, we iterate through the moments, inputting the current number of plays and clears. We check if the current number of plays is correct by comparing it to the previous number of plays. If it is not correct, we set the correctness flag to False and break out of the loop.

Similarly, we check if the current number of clears is correct by comparing it to the previous number of clears. If it is not correct, we set the correctness flag to False and break out of the loop.

If the current number of clears is correct, we update the number of plays and clears.

After iterating through all the moments, we check if the correctness flag is True. If it is, we print "YES" to indicate that the records are correct. Otherwise, we print "NO" to indicate that the records are incorrect
