Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
n = int(input())

x = list(map(int, input().split()))
y = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):
    if x[i] == y[i]:
        continue
    elif x[i] < y[i]:
        print("No")
        break
    elif x[i] > y[i]:
        for j in range(n):
            if y[j] == x[i] - 1 and x[j] == y[j] + 1:
                x[i] -= 1
                x[j] += 1
                break
        else:
            print("No")
            break
else:
    print("Yes")
```

In the code, we first take input for the number of piles, $n$. Then, we take input for the stones in the first array, $x$, and the stones in the second array, $y$.

We then iterate through the elements of the first array, $x$, and check if the corresponding element in the second array, $y$, is equal to the element in $x$. If they are equal, we move on to the next element.

If the element in $y$ is greater than the element in $x$, we print "No" and break out of the loop.

If the element in $y$ is less than the element in $x$, we iterate through the elements of the second array, $y$, and check if there is an element with a value of $x[i] - 1$ and an element with a value of $y[i] + 1$. If we find such elements, we update the values in $x$ and $y$ accordingly.

If we don't find such elements, we print "No" and break out of the loop.

If we don't break out of the loop, we print "Yes".
