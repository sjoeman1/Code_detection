Here is the Python 3 code for solving the Birthday Paradox:

```py
# Input the values of n and k
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize A and B
A = 1
B = 1

# Calculate the number of days in a year
days = 2 ** n

# Calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    A *= (days - i)
    B *= i

# Calculate the greatest common divisor of A and B
gcd = gcd(A, B)
A //= gcd
B //= gcd

# Print the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3
print((A % (10 ** 6 + 3), B % (10 ** 6 + 3)))
```

This code uses the iterative approach to calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. It iterates from 1 to k and updates the values of A and B accordingly. The gcd function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of A and B. Finally, it prints the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3.
