    for operation in s:
        if operation == '-':
            stones -= 1
        else:
            stones += 1

This Python 3 code defines a function `min_stones` that takes two arguments: `n`, the number of operations, and `s`, the string of operations. It initializes two variables, `stones` and `min_stones`, to 0. It then iterates through the string `s` and performs the operations on the `stones` variable. If the operation is "-", it subtracts 1 from `stones`, and if the operation is "+", it adds 1 to `stones`. After each operation, it updates `min_stones` to the minimum value of `min_stones` and `stones`. Finally, it returns the minimum number of stones after all operations.
