Here is the Python 3 code to solve the question:

```
# Input
m, d = map(int, input().split())

# Months with 30 days
months_30 = [4, 6, 9, 11]

# Months with 31 days
months_31 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]

# Initialize number of columns
cols = 0

# Check if it's a leap year
if m == 2:
    # Leap year
    cols = 6
else:
    # Not leap year
    if m in months_30:
        # Month with 30 days
        cols = 6
    elif m in months_31:
        # Month with 31 days
        cols = 5
    else:
        # Month with 28 days
        cols = 5

# Subtract the starting day
cols -= d - 1

# Output
print(cols)
```

In this code, we take the input from the user and store them in the variables `m` and `d`. Then, we initialize the number of columns `cols` to 0. We check if the month is February (2) or not. If it's February, we know it's a leap year, so the number of columns is 6.

Otherwise, we check if the month is in the list `months_30`, which contains the months with 30 days. If it is, we set `cols` to 6. If the month is not in `months_30`, we check if it's in `months_31`, which contains the months with 31 days. If it is, we set `cols` to 5. If it's not in `months_30` or `months_31`, we know it's a month with 28 days, so we set `cols` to 5.

Finally, we subtract the starting day `d` from 1 from `cols` and print the result.
