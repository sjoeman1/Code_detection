 The Python code for the problem statement is provided below:

```python
def count_pairs(n, m):
    # Divide the sum of x and y by 5 and count the number of remainders
    remainders = [0] * 5
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        remainders[x % 5] += 1
    for y in range(1, m + 1):
        remainders[(5 - y % 5) % 5] += 1
    # The number of pairs is the sum of the products of the remainders
    result = 0
    for i in range(1, 5):
        result += remainders[i] * remainders[5 - i]
    return result

# Read the input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
# Calculate the number of pairs
result = count_pairs(n, m)
# Print the result
print(result)
```

This Python code defines a function `count_pairs` that takes the two integers `n` and `m` as input. It then calculates the number of pairs of integers `(x, y)` such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m` and `(x + y)` is divisible by 5. The function uses the modulo operator `%` to calculate the remainders of `x` and `y` when divided by 5. It then counts the number of pairs by multiplying the remainders and summing them up. Finally, it returns the result. The main program takes the input `n` and `m` and prints the result of the `count_pairs` function.
