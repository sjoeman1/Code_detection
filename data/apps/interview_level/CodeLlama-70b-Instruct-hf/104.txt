Here is the Python 3 code to solve the question:

```
n = int(input())
problems = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_problems = sum(problems)
half_problems = total_problems // 2

solved_problems = 0

for i in range(n):
    solved_problems += problems[i]

    if solved_problems >= half_problems:
        print(i + 1)
        break

```

The code first reads the number of days, `n`, from the input. Then, it reads the number of problems to be solved on each day and stores them in the `problems` list.

It calculates the total number of problems and the half of the total problems. Then, it iterates through the `problems` list, adding the number of problems solved on each day to the `solved_problems` variable. If the `solved_problems` exceeds the half of the total problems, it prints the current day's index and breaks out of the loop.

Note that the index starts from 1, so we need to add 1 to the index of the day when printing the result.
