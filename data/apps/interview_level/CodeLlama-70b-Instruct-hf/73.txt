Here is the Python3 code to solve the question:

```python
def calculate_days(c, v_0, v_1, a, l):
    # Initialize variables
    current_page = 0
    days_needed = 0
    daily_read = v_0

    # Check if Mister B can finish the book on the first day
    if c <= v_0:
        return 1

    # Calculate the number of days needed
    while current_page < c:
        # Increment the days needed
        days_needed += 1

        # Calculate the number of pages to read
        if daily_read + a <= v_1:
            daily_read += a
        else:
            daily_read = v_1
        read_pages = daily_read - l

        # Update the current page
        current_page += read_pages

    return days_needed

# Read the input
c, v_0, v_1, a, l = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the number of days needed
days_needed = calculate_days(c, v_0, v_1, a, l)
print(days_needed)
```

This code defines a function `calculate_days` that takes the five input parameters (c, v_0, v_1, a, and l) and calculates the number of days needed for Mister B to finish the book. It uses a while loop to simulate the reading process, incrementing the number of days needed and calculating the number of pages to read each day. If Mister B's reading speed exceeds the maximum reading speed (v_1), it is set to v_1. Finally, it prints the number of days needed to finish the book.
