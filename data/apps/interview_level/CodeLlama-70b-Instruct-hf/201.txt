The following Python 3 code solves the problem:

```python
# This code takes the input as a single line of 5 integers, separated by spaces
# The input is then split into the required variables
input_line = input().split()
C = int(input_line[0])
H_r = int(input_line[1])
H_b = int(input_line[2])
W_r = int(input_line[3])
W_b = int(input_line[4])

# Calculate the maximum number of candies that can be eaten
max_candies = C // (W_r + W_b)

# Calculate the maximum joy units that can be obtained by eating a single candy type
max_joy_r = max_candies * H_r
max_joy_b = max_candies * H_b

# Calculate the maximum joy units that can be obtained by eating both candy types
max_joy_both = (C // W_r) * H_r + (C // W_b) * H_b

# Print the maximum of the three calculated values
print(max(max_joy_r, max_joy_b, max_joy_both))
```

The code takes the input as a single line of 5 integers, separated by spaces. It then calculates the maximum number of candies that can be eaten, the maximum joy units that can be obtained by eating a single candy type, and the maximum joy units that can be obtained by eating both candy types. Finally, it prints the maximum of these three calculated values.
