Here is the Python3 code that solves the question:
```
def who_wins(x_p, y_p, x_v, y_v):
    if x_p == x_v:
        return "Vasiliy" if y_p < y_v else "Polycarp"
    else:
        return "Vasiliy" if x_p < x_v else "Polycarp"

x_p, y_p, x_v, y_v = map(int, input().split())
print(who_wins(x_p, y_p, x_v, y_v))
```
This code works by first checking if the x-coordinates of the pawns are equal. If they are, it checks if the y-coordinate of Polycarp's pawn is less than Vasiliy's, and if so, Vasiliy can reach (0, 0) before Polycarp. If the y-coordinates are equal, it means that Polycarp can reach (0, 0) before Vasiliy.

If the x-coordinates are not equal, the same logic is applied, but with the x-coordinates instead.
