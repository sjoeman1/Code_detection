To solve this problem, we can use the following Python 3 code:

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Define a function to count the number of ways to split a stick
def count_ways(n):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the count for each length
    count = {}
    
    # Calculate the number of ways for each length
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for j in range(i, n // 2 + 1):
            if i * j == n:
                if i not in count:
                    count[i] = 0
                if j not in count:
                    count[j] = 0
                count[i] += 1
                count[j] += 1
    
    # Initialize the number of ways to 0
    ways = 0
    
    # Calculate the number of ways by iterating through the dictionary
    for length, count in count.items():
        ways += count * (count - 1) // 2
    
    # Return the number of ways
    return ways

# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print the number of ways
print(count_ways(n))
```

This code defines a function `count_ways` that takes the length of the stick as input and returns the number of ways to split it into four parts.

The function calculates the number of ways for each length and stores them in a dictionary. It then iterates through the dictionary and calculates the number of ways by taking the product of the count for each length.

Finally, it returns the number of ways.

The program reads the input `n` and calls the `count_ways` function to calculate and print the number of ways to split the stick.
