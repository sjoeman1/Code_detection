The provided question requires us to determine whether a ball will fall into a pocket or not. If it will, we have to find out which pocket it will fall into. The question provides a diagram with four pockets at the corners of a rectangular table. The ball is initially positioned at a point $(x, y)$ and moves along a line parallel to one of the axes or at a $45^\circ$ angle to them.

To solve this problem, we can use the following Python 3 code:

```
# Input
n, m, x, y, v_x, v_y = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the pocket coordinates
pockets = [(0, 0), (n, 0), (0, m), (n, m)]

# Check if the ball is moving horizontally
if v_y == 0:
    if v_x > 0:
        # Check if the ball will hit the right pocket
        if y == 0:
            print(n, 0)
        else:
            print(n, m)
    else:
        # Check if the ball will hit the left pocket
        if y == 0:
            print(0, 0)
        else:
            print(0, m)

# Check if the ball is moving vertically
elif v_x == 0:
    if v_y > 0:
        # Check if the ball will hit the top pocket
        if x == 0:
            print(0, m)
        else:
            print(n, m)
    else:
        # Check if the ball will hit the bottom pocket
        if x == 0:
            print(0, 0)
        else:
            print(n, 0)

# Check if the ball is moving diagonally
else:
    # Calculate the slope and intercept of the ball's trajectory
    slope = v_y / v_x
    intercept = y - slope * x

    # Initialize the coordinates of the intersection points
    x_intersect = None
    y_intersect = None

    # Check if the ball will hit the left or right pocket
    if v_x > 0:
        x
