Here is the Python3 code for solving the problem:

```python
# This function takes as input the number of days, the number of days chosen for sell-out,
# and the number of products and clients on each day.
def solve(n, f, products, clients):
    # We sort the days based on the number of products on sale on each day.
    days = sorted(zip(products, clients), key=lambda x: x[0])
    # We calculate the total number of products sold on each day.
    sold = [products[i] - max(0, clients[i] - products[i]) for i in range(n)]
    # We calculate the number of products sold on each day if the sell-out is held.
    sold_sellout = [2 * products[i] - max(0, clients[i] - 2 * products[i]) for i in range(n)]
    # We calculate the total number of products sold if the sell-out is held.
    sold_sellout_total = sum(sold_sellout)
    # We calculate the total number of products sold without the sell-out.
    sold_total = sum(sold)
    # We initialize the answer to the total number of products sold without the sell-out.
    ans = sold_total
    # We iterate over the days.
    for i in range(n):
        # We calculate the total number of products sold with the sell-out on the current day.
        sold_sellout_total_new = sold_sellout_total + sold[i] - sold_sellout[i]
        # We update the answer if the new total is larger.
        ans = max(ans, sold_sellout_total_new)
    # We return the answer.
    return ans

# This function reads the input from the user.
def main():
    # We read the number of days and the number of days chosen for sell-out.
    n, f = map(int, input().split())
    # We initialize the lists for the number of products and clients on each day.
    products = []
    clients = []
    # We read the input for each day.
    for _ in range
