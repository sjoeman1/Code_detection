Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_index = []
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == min(arr):
        min_index.append(i)

min_distance = n
for i in range(len(min_index)-1):
    if min_index[i+1] - min_index[i] < min_distance:
        min_distance = min_index[i+1] - min_index[i]

print(min_distance)
```

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1.  The first line reads the number of elements in the array.
2.  The second line reads the array elements and converts them to integers.
3.  The for loop iterates through the array and appends the indices of the minimum elements to the min_index list.
4.  The second for loop iterates through the min_index list and calculates the distance between consecutive minimum elements.
5.  The min_distance variable stores the minimum distance between two consecutive minimum elements.
6.  Finally, the minimum distance is printed.
