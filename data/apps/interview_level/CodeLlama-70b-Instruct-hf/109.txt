Here's the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
def calculate_expected_caught_fishes(n, m, r, k):
    # Calculate the number of possible positions for the scoop-net
    num_possible_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)

    # Calculate the number of cells that can be occupied by fishes
    num_occupiable_cells = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)

    # Calculate the expected number of caught fishes
    expected_caught_fishes = k * num_possible_positions / num_occupiable_cells

    return expected_caught_fishes

# Read the input
n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the expected number of caught fishes
expected_caught_fishes = calculate_expected_caught_fishes(n, m, r, k)

# Print the result
print(expected_caught_fishes)
```

The code first calculates the number of possible positions for the scoop-net and the number of cells that can be occupied by fishes. Then it calculates the expected number of caught fishes using the formula provided in the problem statement. Finally, it prints the expected number of caught fishes.
