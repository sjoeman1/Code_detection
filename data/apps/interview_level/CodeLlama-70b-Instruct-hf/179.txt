The task is to find the number of permutations of size n that contain x at position pos and for which the given implementation of the binary search algorithm finds x (returns true).



Here's the Python3 code to solve this problem:

```
# n: length of the permutation
# x: number to search
# pos: required position of x
def count_permutations(n, x, pos):
    # Initialize result as 0
    result = 0

    # Find the number of permutations where x is at position pos
    for i in range(n - pos):
        result += (n - pos) * factorial(n - pos - 1)

    # Subtract the number of permutations where x is not at position pos
    result -= (n - pos) * factorial(n - pos - 1)

    # Return the result modulo 10^9+7
    return result % (10 ** 9 + 7)

# Calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Main program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Read input from the user
    n, x, pos = map(int, input().split())

    # Call the function to count permutations
    result = count_permutations(n, x, pos)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
```

The function `count_permutations` calculates the number of permutations where x is at position pos. It uses the formula `(n - pos) * factorial(n - pos - 1)` to calculate the number of permutations where x is at position pos. Then, it subtracts `(n - pos) * factorial(n - pos - 1)` to remove the number of permutations where x is not at position pos. Finally, it returns the result modulo 10^9+7. The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number.
