Here is the Python 3 code that will solve the question:

```python
# Input: n - initial number of commentary boxes,
#        m - number of delegations,
#        a - fee to build a box,
#        b - fee to demolish a box

n, m, a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Check if n is divisible by m
if n % m == 0:
    # If n is divisible by m, no burles needed
    print(0)
else:
    # Calculate the number of boxes needed to be built or demolished
    boxes_needed = m - (n % m)
    # Calculate the cost to build or demolish the required number of boxes
    cost = min(boxes_needed * a, boxes_needed * b)
    # Print the minimum cost
    print(cost)
```

This code takes four inputs: `n`, the initial number of commentary boxes, `m`, the number of delegations, `a`, the fee to build a box, and `b`, the fee to demolish a box. It then checks if `n` is divisible by `m`. If it is, it prints `0`, indicating that no burles are needed. If `n` is not divisible by `m`, it calculates the number of boxes needed to be built or demolished, and then calculates the minimum cost to build or demolish that number of boxes. Finally, it prints the minimum cost.
