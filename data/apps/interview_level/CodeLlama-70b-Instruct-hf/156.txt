The code for solving the problem is given below:

```python
# Input the value of X
X = int(input())

# Initialize a and b to 1
a = 1
b = 1

# Check if X is odd or even
if X % 2 == 0:
    # If X is even, set a = 1 and b = 2
    a = 1
    b = 2
else:
    # If X is odd, set a = 1 and b = X
    a = 1
    b = X

# Calculate the LCM of a and b
lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Check if the LCM is equal to X
if lcm == X:
    # If it is, print the values of a and b
    print(a, b)
else:
    # If it is not, print a message indicating that no solution exists
    print("No solution")
```

The code first takes an integer input from the user, representing the value of $X$. It then initializes variables $a$ and $b$ to 1. If $X$ is even, it sets $a = 1$ and $b = 2$. If $X$ is odd, it sets $a = 1$ and $b = X$. It then calculates the LCM of $a$ and $b$ using the formula $(a * b) // gcd(a, b)$. If the LCM is equal to $X$, it prints the values of $a$ and $b$. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that no solution exists.
