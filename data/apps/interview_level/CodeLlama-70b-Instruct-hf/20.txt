Here is a Python3 code that solves the question:

```python
def get_minutes_to_palindrome(current_time):
    hours, minutes = current_time.split(":")
    hours = int(hours)
    minutes = int(minutes)

    # Check if the current time is a palindrome
    if hours == hours % 10 * 10 + hours // 10 and minutes == minutes % 10 * 10 + minutes // 10:
        return 0

    # Increment the time by 1 minute
    minutes += 1
    if minutes == 60:
        minutes = 0
        hours += 1
        if hours == 24:
            hours = 0

    # Check if the new time is a palindrome
    if hours == hours % 10 * 10 + hours // 10 and minutes == minutes % 10 * 10 + minutes // 10:
        return 1

    # Increment the time by 1 minute
    minutes += 1
    if minutes == 60:
        minutes = 0
        hours += 1
        if hours == 24:
            hours = 0

    # Check if the new time is a palindrome
    if hours == hours % 10 * 10 + hours // 10 and minutes == minutes % 10 * 10 + minutes // 10:
        return 2

    # Increment the time by 1 minute
    minutes += 1
    if minutes == 60:
        minutes = 0
        hours += 1
        if hours == 24:
            hours = 0

    # Check if the new time is a palindrome
    if hours == hours % 10 * 10 + hours // 10 and minutes == minutes % 10 * 10 + minutes // 10:
        return 3

    # Increment the time by 1 minute
    minutes += 1
    if minutes == 60:
        minutes = 0
        hours += 1
        if hours == 24:
            hours =
