Here is the code:
```
n, m, r = map(int, input().split())
s = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
s.sort()
b.sort()
shares = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] <= r:
        r -= s[i]
        shares += 1
    else:
        break
r = 0
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] <= shares:
        r += b[i]
        shares -= b[i]
    else:
        break
print(r)
```

The code first reads the input values of `n`, `m`, and `r`. Then, it reads the `s` values and the `b` values. The `s` values are sorted in ascending order, and the `b` values are sorted in descending order. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the `r` bourles. Then, it calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be earned by selling the shares. Finally, it prints the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening.
