Here is the Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```
def get_digit(k):
    # Find the length of the number where the k-th digit is from
    digit = 1
    while k > digit * 9 * 10 ** (digit - 1):
        k -= digit * 9 * 10 ** (digit - 1)
        digit += 1

    # Find the actual number where the k-th digit is from
    number = 10 ** (digit - 1) + (k - 1) // digit

    # Find the k-th digit and return it
    return int(str(number)[(k - 1) % digit])

# Read input from stdin
k = int(input())

# Print the result
print(get_digit(k))
```

The `get_digit` function takes a number `k` as input and calculates the `k-th` digit of the sequence. It does this by first finding the length of the number where the `k-th` digit is from. It then finds the actual number where the `k-th` digit is from and extracts the digit from the number.

The `get_digit` function is then called with the input `k` and the result is printed.
