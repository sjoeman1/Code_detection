Here is the Python3 code to solve the question:

```
# Input
W = int(input())
cnt = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the maximum possible weight of a good subset
max_weight = 0
for i in range(1, 9):
    if cnt[i-1] > 0 and i <= W:
        max_weight = max(max_weight, i)

print(max_weight)
```

This code takes the input `W` and the `cnt` list as described in the question. It iterates through the `cnt` list from index 0 to 7 (i.e., from `cnt_1` to `cnt_8`), and checks if the current weight (`i`) is less than or equal to `W`. If the condition is met, it updates the `max_weight` variable with the maximum of its current value and `i`. This ensures that `max_weight` will hold the maximum possible weight of a good subset.

Finally, it prints the `max_weight` variable, which is the maximum possible weight of a good subset of items.
