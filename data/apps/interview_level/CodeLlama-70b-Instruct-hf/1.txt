This question asks us to find the integer that has the maximum sum of digits and doesn't exceed the given number x.

Here is the Python 3 code to solve the question:

```
# Define the function to find the maximum sum of digits
def max_sum_of_digits(x):
    # Initialize the maximum sum of digits
    max_sum = 0
    # Initialize the integer with the maximum sum of digits
    max_num = 0
    # Iterate through the integers from 1 to x
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        # Calculate the sum of digits of the current integer
        current_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        # If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            # Update the maximum sum
            max_sum = current_sum
            # Update the integer with the maximum sum of digits
            max_num = i
        # If the current sum is equal to the maximum sum
        elif current_sum == max_sum:
            # Update the integer with the maximum sum of digits if it is larger than the current maximum integer
            if i > max_num:
                max_num = i
    # Return the integer with the maximum sum of digits
    return max_num

# Read the input from the user
x = int(input())
# Call the function to find the integer with the maximum sum of digits
result = max_sum_of_digits(x)
# Print the result
print(result)
