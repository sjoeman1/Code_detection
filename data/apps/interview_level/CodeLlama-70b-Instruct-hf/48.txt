Here's the Python3 code:

```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
numbers = []
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, m + 1):
        numbers.append(i * j)
numbers.sort()
print(numbers[k - 1])
```

This code takes the input for the three integers n, m, and k, where n and m represent the dimensions of the multiplication table, and k represents the k-th largest number. It then iterates through the multiplication table and appends each number to a list called numbers. After the list is populated, it sorts the numbers in ascending order. Finally, it prints the k-th largest number from the sorted list.
