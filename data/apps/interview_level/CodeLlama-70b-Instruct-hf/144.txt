Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
ticket = input()

def is_lucky_ticket(ticket):
    for i in range(1, len(ticket)):
        sum1 = sum(map(int, ticket[:i]))
        sum2 = sum(map(int, ticket[i:]))
        if sum1 == sum2:
            return True
    return False

if is_lucky_ticket(ticket):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

The code starts by reading the number of digits `n` and the ticket as a string. It then defines a function `is_lucky_ticket` that takes the ticket as input. This function uses a loop to iterate over all possible segment sizes, starting from 1 to the length of the ticket. Inside the loop, it calculates the sum of the first segment (`sum1`) and the sum of the second segment (`sum2`). If the sums are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the ticket is lucky. If the loop finishes without finding any equal sums, it returns `False`.

Finally, the code calls the `is_lucky_ticket` function with the input ticket and prints "YES" if the ticket is lucky, or "NO" otherwise.
