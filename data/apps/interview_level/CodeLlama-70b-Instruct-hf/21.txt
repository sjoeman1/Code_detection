Here is the Python3 code for solving the problem:

```
n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the index of the minimum element
min_index = a.index(1)

# Find the index of the maximum element
max_index = a.index(n)

# Initialize the maximum distance
max_distance = -1

# Loop through all indices of the array
for i in range(n):
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the indices
    # of the minimum and maximum elements
    distance = abs(i - (n - i - 1))

    # Update the maximum distance if the current distance is greater
    max_distance = max(max_distance, distance)

# Print the maximum distance
print(max_distance)
```

This code reads the input and finds the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in the array. It then iterates through all the indices of the array and calculates the absolute difference between the indices of the minimum and maximum elements. Finally, it prints the maximum distance achieved by performing exactly one swap.
