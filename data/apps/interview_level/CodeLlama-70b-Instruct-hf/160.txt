1. The Python 3 code for the question is provided below:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def answer(N, K, A):
    g = A[0]
    for i in range(1, N):
        g = gcd(g, A[i])
    for i in range(N):
        A[i] //= g
    for i in range(K):
        mx = 0
        for j in range(N):
            mx = max(mx, A[j])
        A[mx] -= 1
        g = gcd(g, mx + 1)
    return g

N, K = list(map(int, input().split()))
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(answer(N, K, A))
```

In the code, we define a function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The `answer` function calculates the maximum positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The `gcd` function is used to calculate the GCD of all the elements of the array A. Then, we perform the operations K times and update the GCD. Finally, we return the maximum positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
