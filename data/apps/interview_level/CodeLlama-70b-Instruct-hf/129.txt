Here is the Python3 code that solves the problem:

```python
N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())

if L <= M:
    print(M - K)
else:
    if L - M > N - K:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(N - K - (L - M))
```

In this code, we first read the input values for N, M, K, and L. Then, we check if L is less than or equal to M. If it is, we print M - K as the minimum number of coins required.

If L is greater than M, we check if L - M is greater than N - K. If it is, then it is not possible to meet all the conditions, and we print -1.

Otherwise, we print N - K - (L - M), which is the minimum number of coins required to meet the conditions.
