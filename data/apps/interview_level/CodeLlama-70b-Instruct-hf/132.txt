In this problem, we need to find the minimum difference between angles of two sectors that will go to Vasya and Petya. Each sector is a continuous segment of the pizza circle.

Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Function to find the minimum difference between angles of sectors
def min_difference(a):
    n = len(a)
    # Initialize the minimum difference as the maximum possible value
    min_diff = 360
    # Sort the angles in ascending order
    a.sort()
    # Traverse the array from the first element to the last
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the difference between the angles of two sectors
        diff = abs(a[i] - a[n-1-i])
        # Update the minimum difference if a smaller value is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    # If the array contains 180 degrees, then the minimum difference is 0
    if 180 in a:
        min_diff = 0
    # Return the minimum difference
    return min_diff

# Main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = min_difference(a)
    print(result)
```

The `min_difference` function takes an array of angles `a` as input and calculates the minimum difference between angles of two sectors.

*   We sort the angles in ascending order to ensure that the adjacent sectors are placed side by side.
*   We traverse the array from the first element to the last, calculating the difference between the angles of two sectors.
*   We update the minimum difference if a smaller value is found.
*   If the array contains 180 degrees, then the minimum difference is 0.

The main function reads the number of pieces and the angles of each piece. It then calls the `min_difference` function to calculate the minimum difference and prints the result.
