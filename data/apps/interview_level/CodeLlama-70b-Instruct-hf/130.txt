Here's a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
# This function returns the number of cells to be painted black to form a square
def minimum_painted_cells(n, m, grid):
    # Initialize the number of cells to be painted with -1
    painted_cells = -1
    
    # Iterate over all possible square sizes
    for size in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
        # Initialize a counter for black cells in the current size square
        black_cells = 0
        # Iterate over all rows and columns
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                # Check if the current cell is within the square
                if i < size and j < size:
                    # Increase the black cells counter if the cell is black
                    if grid[i][j] == 'B':
                        black_cells += 1
                else:
                    # Increase the black cells counter if the cell is white
                    if grid[i][j] == 'W':
                        black_cells += 1
        # Update the minimum number of painted cells if necessary
        if painted_cells == -1 or black_cells < painted_cells:
            painted_cells = black_cells
    
    # Return the minimum number of painted cells
    return painted_cells

# Read the input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
grid = []
for _ in range(n):
    grid.append(input())

# Calculate the minimum number of cells to be painted
painted_cells = minimum_painted_cells(n, m, grid)

# Print the output
print(painted_cells)
```

This code first defines a function `minimum_painted_cells` that takes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, and the grid of cells `grid` as input. It iterates over all possible square sizes from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and for each size, it counts the number of black cells inside the square and the number of white cells outside the
