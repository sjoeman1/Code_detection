Here is the Python3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Python3 code
n, m = map(int, input().split())

while True:
    if n == 0 or m == 0:
        break
    elif n >= 2 * m:
        n -= 2 * m
    elif m >= 2 * n:
        m -= 2 * n
    else:
        break

print(n, m)
```

This code first takes the input of the two integers, n and m, from the user. It then enters an infinite loop. In the loop, it checks if either n or m is equal to 0. If so, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it checks if n is greater than or equal to 2 times m. If it is, it subtracts 2 times m from n. If not, it checks if m is greater than or equal to 2 times n. If it is, it subtracts 2 times n from m. If neither of these conditions is met, the loop breaks. After the loop, it prints the values of n and m.
