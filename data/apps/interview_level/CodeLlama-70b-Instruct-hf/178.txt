ðŸ¤– Here is a possible solution in Python 3:

```python
def is_valid_phone_number(s):
    # Check if the string is a valid phone number
    if len(s) == 11 and s[0] == '8':
        return True
    return False

def has_winning_strategy(s):
    # Base case: if the string is a valid phone number, Vasya wins
    if is_valid_phone_number(s):
        return True
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Erase the current character
        new_s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
        
        # If Petya can't win after this move, Vasya wins
        if not has_winning_strategy(new_s):
            return True
    
    # If none of the moves lead to a win for Vasya, Petya wins
    return False

# Read the input
n = int(input())
s = input()

# Determine if Vasya has a winning strategy
if has_winning_strategy(s):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This solution recursively checks if Petya has a winning strategy after each possible move by Vasya. If Petya cannot win after any of Vasya's moves, Vasya has a winning strategy.
