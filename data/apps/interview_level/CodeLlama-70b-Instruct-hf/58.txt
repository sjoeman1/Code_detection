Here's the Python 3 code that meets the requirements:

```
n = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

# The total length of all sides of the frames for two doors
total_length = 2 * (2 * a + b)

# Calculate the number of bars needed
bars_needed = total_length // n
if total_length % n != 0:
    bars_needed += 1

print(bars_needed)
```

The code starts by reading the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`. Then, it calculates the total length of all sides of the frames for two doors. Next, it calculates the number of bars needed by dividing the total length by `n` and rounding up to the nearest integer. Finally, it prints the number of bars needed.
