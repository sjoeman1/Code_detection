Here's the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```py
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
def isLucky(n):
    n = str(n)
    return all(x == '0' for x in n) or len(n) == 1

n = int(input())

while True:
    n += 1
    if isLucky(n):
        break

print(n - year)
```

Explanation:

1.  The `isLucky` function checks if a given number is lucky or not. It converts the number to a string and checks if all digits are zeroes or if it's a single digit.
2.  In the main code, we read the input `n` and initialize a loop that iterates from the current year (`n`) until a lucky year is found.
3.  Inside the loop, we increment `n` by 1 and check if it's lucky using the `isLucky` function.
4.  When a lucky year is found, we break out of the loop and print the number of years from the current year to the next lucky one.
