Here is the Python3 code that solves the question:

```
# Input
s = input()

# Empty strings t and u
t = ""
u = ""

# Loop through the characters of s
for c in s:
    # Append the character to t
    t += c
    # Check if t is lexicographically greater than u
    if t > u:
        # Swap t and u
        t, u = u, t

# Print the result
print(u)
```

The code starts by reading the input string s. Then, it initializes empty strings t and u. For each character c in s, it appends c to t. If t is lexicographically greater than u, it swaps t and u. Finally, it prints the resulting string u.
