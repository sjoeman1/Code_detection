Here's the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
# Taking input from the user
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Initializing the list for Hitagi's sequence
a = [0] * n

# Taking input for Hitagi's sequence
for i in range(n):
    a[i] = int(input().split()[i])

# Initializing the list for Kaiki's sequence
b = [0] * k

# Taking input for Kaiki's sequence
for i in range(k):
    b[i] = int(input().split()[i])

# Function to check if the sequence is increasing or not
def is_increasing(sequence):
    for i in range(len(sequence) - 1):
        if sequence[i] >= sequence[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

# Function to solve the question
def solve_question(a, b):
    # Creating a copy of Hitagi's sequence
    sequence = a.copy()

    # Replacing the zeros in Hitagi's sequence with elements from Kaiki's sequence
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            sequence[i] = b.pop()

    # Checking if the resulting sequence is increasing
    if is_increasing(sequence):
        return "No"
    else:
        return "Yes"

# Calling the function to solve the question
result = solve_question(a, b)

# Printing the result
print(result)

```

This Python code will take input from the user, calculate the resulting sequence, and determine whether it is increasing or not. If it is increasing, it will output "No", and if it is not increasing, it will output "Yes".
