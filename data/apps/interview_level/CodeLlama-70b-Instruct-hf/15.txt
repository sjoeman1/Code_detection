Here is the Python3 code for the problem:

```python
# input integers a, b, c
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

# check if b is a multiple of c + a
if ((b - a) % c == 0):
    # b is a multiple of c + a, print "YES"
    print("YES")
else:
    # b is not a multiple of c + a, print "NO"
    print("NO")
```

This code will solve the problem by checking if the difference between b and a is a multiple of c. If it is, then b is a part of the sequence and it will print "YES". Otherwise, it will print "NO".
