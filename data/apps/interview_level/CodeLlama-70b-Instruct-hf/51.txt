Here's the Python3 code to solve the question:

```python
def solve(t):
    n = len(t)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if t[i:] == t[:n-i]:
            return True, t[:i]
    return False, ""

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = input()
    possible, s = solve(t)

    if possible:
        print("YES")
        print(s)
    else:
        print("NO")
```

This code defines a function `solve` that takes a string `t` as input. It iterates over all possible prefixes of `t` and checks if the remaining suffix of `t` is equal to the prefix. If this is the case, it returns `True` and the prefix as the solution. If no such prefix is found, it returns `False` and an empty string.

In the main part of the code, the input string `t` is read from the standard input, and the `solve` function is called with `t` as input. The function's output is then printed according to the given rules.
