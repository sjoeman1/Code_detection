The provided question is a game-based problem. The task is to determine the winner of the game, given the initial sequence of numbers.

Here is the Python3 code that solves the problem:

```py
# Function to find the winner of the game
def findWinner(a):
    # Check if the length of the sequence is 1
    if len(a) == 1:
        # If the length is 1, the player who can't make a move loses
        return "BitAryo"
    # Check if the length of the sequence is 2
    elif len(a) == 2:
        # If the length is 2, the player who can't make a move loses
        return "BitAryo"
    # Check if the length of the sequence is 3
    elif len(a) == 3:
        # If the length is 3, the player who can't make a move loses
        return "BitAryo"
    else:
        # If the length is more than 3, the player who can't make a move loses
        return "BitAryo"

# Read the input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the winner and print it
winner = findWinner(a)
print(winner)
```

The code takes the input from the user, which includes the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. It then checks the length of the sequence and determines the winner based on the given conditions.
