This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Here's the Python 3 code:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Inputs
n = int(input())  # Number of pieces
p = int(input())  # Wanted parity
colors = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Colors of the pieces

# Calculate the number of valid paths of alternating colors
dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(n + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1]
    dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] * (i - 1)

# Calculate the number of ways to color the pieces
ways = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if colors[i - 1] == -1:
        ways *= 2

# Calculate the result
result = dp[n][p] * ways

# Print the result modulo 10^9 + 7
print(result % (10 ** 9 + 7))
```

This code first calculates the number of valid paths of alternating colors using dynamic programming. Then, it calculates the number of ways to color the pieces, taking into account the pre-painted pieces. Finally, it calculates the result by multiplying the number of valid paths and the number of ways to color the pieces, and then takes the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
