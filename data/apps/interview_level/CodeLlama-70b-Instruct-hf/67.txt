Here is the Python3 code that solves the question:

```py
x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
if z == 0:
    if x > y:
        print('+')
    elif y > x:
        print('-')
    else:
        print('0')
else:
    if (x + z) > y:
        if x > y:
            print('+')
        else:
            print('?')
    elif (x + z) < y:
        if y > x:
            print('-')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```

The code first reads the input integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user. It then checks if `z` is zero, which indicates that there are no unknown persons. If `z` is zero, it checks if `x` is greater than `y` to determine if the result is "+", if `y` is greater than `x` to determine if the result is "-", or if `x` is equal to `y` to determine if the result is "0".

If `z` is not zero, it checks if the sum of `x` and `z` is greater than `y`, which means there are more upvotes than downvotes. If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints "+", but if `x` is not greater than `y`, it prints "?".

If the sum of `x` and `z` is less than `y`, it means there are more downvotes than upvotes. If `y` is greater than `x`, it prints "-", but if `y` is not greater than `x`, it prints "?".

If the sum of `x` and `z` is equal to `y`, it means there are an equal number of upvotes and downvotes. In this case, it prints "?".
