Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
import re

# Read input from STDIN
password = input()

# Check if password meets all conditions
if len(password) >= 5 and re.search(r"[A-Z]", password) and re.search(r"[a-z]", password) and re.search(r"[0-9]", password):
    print("Correct")
else:
    print("Too weak")
```

The code starts by importing the `re` module, which is used for regular expression matching.

Next, it reads the password input from STDIN using the `input()` function.

Then, it checks if the password meets all the conditions using the `if` statement. The conditions are:

1. The password length is at least 5 characters (`len(password) >= 5`).
2. The password contains at least one large English letter (`re.search(r"[A-Z]", password)`).
3. The password contains at least one small English letter (`re.search(r"[a-z]", password)`).
4. The password contains at least one digit (`re.search(r"[0-9]", password)`).

If all the conditions are met, it prints "Correct" to STDOUT. Otherwise, it prints "Too weak" to STDOUT.
