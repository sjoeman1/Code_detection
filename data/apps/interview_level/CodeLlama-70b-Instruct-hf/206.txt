Here's the Python 3 code for the problem:

```python
def frog_jump(x, a, b):
    f = [0] * (x + 1)
    f[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        for j in range(i - b, i + a + 1):
            if 0 <= j <= x:
                f[j] = 1
    return sum(f)

def main():
    m, a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        result += frog_jump(i, a, b)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, the `frog_jump` function calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it starts from 0. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of integers reachable from each position. The `main` function then calls the `frog_jump` function for each value of `i` from 0 to `m` and sums up the results.
