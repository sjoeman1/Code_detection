Here is the Python3 code to solve the question:

```python
n = int(input())
employees = input()

# Create a list to store the order of denials
denials = [0] * n

# Create a list to store the order of voting
voting_order = []

# Initialize the number of depublicans and remocrats
depublicans = 0
remocrats = 0

# Initialize the number of depublicans and remocrats who can vote
depublicans_can_vote = 0
remocrats_can_vote = 0

# Initialize the number of depublicans and remocrats who have been denied from voting
depublicans_denied = 0
remocrats_denied = 0

# Iterate through the employees
for i in range(n):
    # Check if the employee is a depublican
    if employees[i] == 'D':
        depublicans += 1

        # Check if the employee can vote
        if denials[i] == 0:
            depublicans_can_vote += 1
    else:
        remocrats += 1

        # Check if the employee can vote
        if denials[i] == 0:
            remocrats_can_vote += 1

    # Check if the employee denies someone from voting
    if i != n - 1:
        # Check if the next employee is a depublican
        if employees[i + 1] == 'D':
            denials[i + 1] += 1
            depublicans_denied += 1
        else:
            denials[i + 1] += 1
            remocrats_denied += 1

# Iterate through the employees again
for i in range(n):
    # Check if the employee can vote
    if denials[i] == 0:
        voting_order.append(i + 1)

# Print the voting order
print("Voting order:", voting_order)

# Check if there is only one depublican who can vote
if depublicans_can_vote == 1
