This is a simple mathematical problem. Here's the Python code:

```
def max_team_size(l, r, a):
    team_size = 0
    if l + r > a:
        team_size = 2 * min(l, r) + a
    elif l + r <= a and l + r > 0:
        team_size = l + r
    return team_size

l, r, a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
team_size = max_team_size(l, r, a)
print(team_size)
```

This code takes three integers as input, representing the number of left-handers, right-handers, and ambidexters. It then calculates the maximum team size based on the constraints given in the problem statement.
