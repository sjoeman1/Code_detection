Here is the Python 3 code for solving the question:

```python
def count_years(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        binary = bin(year)[2:]
        if binary.count('0') == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(count_years(a, b))
```

This code defines a function `count_years` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`. It iterates over the range from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and converts each number to its binary representation. It then checks if the binary representation contains exactly one `0` and increments the `count` variable accordingly. Finally, it returns the `count`. The input is taken from the user, and the function is called with the given input. The result is then printed.
