 Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```py
d, k, a, b, t = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize time and distance
time = 0
distance = 0

# Travel until the destination is reached
while distance < d:
    # Drive on car until it breaks
    time += min(k, d - distance) * a
    distance += min(k, d - distance)
    # If the destination is not reached yet
    if distance < d:
        # Repair the car
        time += t
        # Walk until the car can be driven again
        time += (k - (d - distance)) * b
        distance += k - (d - distance)

print(time)
```

This code takes the input, initializes the variables, and then uses a while loop to travel until the destination is reached. Inside the loop, it calculates the time spent driving on the car, repairing the car, and walking. Finally, it prints the minimum time needed to reach the destination.
