Here is the Python3 code for the question:

```python
# input the user name
name = input()

# count the number of distinct characters
distinct_chars = len(set(name))

# if the number of distinct characters is odd, then he is a male
if distinct_chars % 2 == 1:
    print("IGNORE HIM!")
# otherwise, she is a female
else:
    print("CHAT WITH HER!")
```

This code will take the user name as input, count the number of distinct characters in the user name, and then print "IGNORE HIM!" if the number of distinct characters is odd, or "CHAT WITH HER!" if the number of distinct characters is even.
