This problem can be solved using a Python 3 script. Here is the code:

```py
# Input the number of elements in the array
n = int(input())

# Input the array
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the count of consecutive elements that can be erased
count = 0

# Iterate through the array
for i in range(n - 1):
    # Check if the current element is less than the next element
    if a[i] < a[i + 1]:
        # If so, increment the count
        count += 1
    else:
        # If not, reset the count
        count = 0

# Print the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased
print(count)
```

In this code, we first take the number of elements in the array as input. Then, we input the array elements as a list of integers.

Next, we initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased.

In the loop, we iterate through the array elements and check if the current element is less than the next element. If this is the case, we increment the `count` variable. This way, we can keep track of the maximum number of consecutive elements that are in ascending order.

When we encounter an element that is not less than the next element, we reset the `count` variable to zero.

Finally, we print the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased, which is the value of the `count` variable.
