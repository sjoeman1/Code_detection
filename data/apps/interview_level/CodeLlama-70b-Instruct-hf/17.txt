The code for solving this problem is as follows:

```
# Python3 code to solve the given problem

# Function to calculate the number of spectators standing at a given time
def standing_spectators(n, k, t):
    # If time t is greater than n + k, then all spectators are sitting
    if t > n + k:
        return 0
    # If time t is less than n, then at most t spectators can be standing
    if t < n:
        return t
    # Otherwise, the number of spectators standing at time t is given by
    return n - ((t - 1) % k)

# Main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Take input from user
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate and print the number of standing spectators
    print(standing_spectators(n, k, t))
```

This code uses a function `standing_spectators` to calculate the number of standing spectators at time `t`. It takes three arguments: `n` (the total number of spectators), `k` (the number of spectators that stand and sit in each cycle), and `t` (the time at which we want to find the number of standing spectators).

In the `standing_spectators` function, we first check if `t` is greater than `n + k`. If it is, then all spectators will be sitting at that time, and we return 0.

If `t` is less than `n`, then at most `t` spectators can be standing at that time. We return `t` in this case.

If `t` is greater than or equal to `n`, then we calculate the number of spectators standing at that time using the formula `n - ((t - 1) % k)`. This formula works because the number of spectators standing at time `t` is always equal to `n` minus the number of spectators that have sat down since time `t - 1`. The `(t - 1) % k` part of the formula determines the number of spectators that have sat down since time `t - 1`, and we subtract this from `n` to get the number of standing spectators
