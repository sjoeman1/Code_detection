Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
#input
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

#sorting the list in ascending order
a.sort()

#initializing a variable to keep track of the number of hours
hours = 0

#initializing a variable to keep track of the length of the garden that has been watered
watered = 0

#looping through the list of buckets
for i in range(n):
    #checking if the garden has been fully watered
    if watered >= k:
        break
    #checking if the current bucket can water the remaining part of the garden
    if a[i] + watered <= k:
        #increasing the number of hours
        hours += 1
        #increasing the length of the garden that has been watered
        watered += a[i]

#printing the minimum number of hours required to water the garden
print(hours)
```

The code takes input for the number of buckets (n) and the length of the garden (k). Then it takes input for the length of each bucket (a). It sorts the list of buckets in ascending order. It initializes a variable to keep track of the number of hours (hours) and the length of the garden that has been watered (watered). It loops through the list of buckets and checks if the garden has been fully watered. If it has, it breaks out of the loop. If it hasn't, it checks if the current bucket can water the remaining part of the garden. If it can, it increases the number of hours and the length of the garden that has been watered. Finally, it prints the minimum number of hours required to water the garden.
