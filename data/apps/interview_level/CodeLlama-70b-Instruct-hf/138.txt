Here is the Python3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def solve(n, a, b, c):
    # Initialize the cost
    cost = 0
    # If n is already divisible by 4, no need to buy anything
    if n % 4 == 0:
        return 0
    # Calculate the number of copybooks required to make n divisible by 4
    required = 4 - (n % 4)
    # Initialize the cost of buying required number of copybooks
    cost_required = required * a
    # Check if buying a pack of 2 copybooks is cheaper
    cost_required = min(cost_required, required // 2 * b + required % 2 * a)
    # Check if buying a pack of 3 copybooks is cheaper
    cost_required = min(cost_required, required // 3 * c + (required % 3) // 2 * b + (required % 3) % 2 * a)
    # Return the minimum cost
    return cost_required

# Input
n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
# Output
print(solve(n, a, b, c))
```

This code uses a function `solve` that takes 4 parameters `n, a, b, c` and returns the minimum cost.

The function first checks if `n` is already divisible by 4. If so, it returns 0.

If `n` is not divisible by 4, it calculates the number of copybooks required to make `n` divisible by 4 (`4 - (n % 4)`).

It then calculates the cost of buying that number of copybooks (`required * a`).

It then checks if buying a pack of 2 copybooks is cheaper than buying the required number of individual copybooks. If it is, it updates the cost accordingly.

It then checks if buying a pack of 3 copybooks is cheaper than buying the required number of individual copybooks or packs of 2 copybooks. If it is, it updates the cost accordingly.

Finally, it returns the minimum cost.

The code then takes input for
