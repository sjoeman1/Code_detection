Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
def find_missed_meals(b, d, s):
    # Calculate the total number of meals in the dining room
    total_meals = b + d + s
    # Calculate the minimum number of meals in the dining room
    min_meals = min(b, d, s)
    # Calculate the maximum number of meals in the dining room
    max_meals = max(b, d, s)
    # Calculate the number of days Vasiliy was in the sanatorium
    days = total_meals - min_meals
    # Calculate the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed
    missed_meals = max(0, total_meals - days - max_meals)
    return missed_meals

# Read input from stdin
b, d, s = map(int, input().split())
# Calculate and print the result
result = find_missed_meals(b, d, s)
print(result)
```

The `find_missed_meals` function takes three integers `b`, `d`, and `s` as input, representing the number of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium.

It first calculates the total number of meals in the dining room, which is the sum of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers. Then, it calculates the minimum number of meals in the dining room, which is the minimum of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers. Similarly, it calculates the maximum number of meals in the dining room.

Next, it calculates the number of days Vasiliy was in the sanatorium, which is the total number of meals minus the minimum number of meals in the dining room. This is because Vasiliy could have missed some meals on the arrival day before his arrival and meals on the departure day after he left.

Finally, it calculates the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation, which is the maximum of zero and the difference between the total number of meals and the number of days
