Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
# Input
seat = input()

# Extract row and seat
row = int(seat[:-1])
seat = seat[-1]

# Initialize variables
served = 0
step = 2

# Calculate time taken
while True:
    # Check if Vasya's row is reached
    if row <= step:
        break
    # Increase served seats and step
    served += 6 * step
    step += 3

# Calculate remaining time
remaining = 6 * (row - step) + 1 + "abcdef".index(seat)

# Print result
print(served + remaining)
```

This code will take the input of Vasya's seat, extract the row and seat number, and then calculate the time it takes for him to receive his lunch. It does this by iterating through the rows and calculating the time taken to serve each row, until Vasya's row is reached. Then, it calculates the remaining time by subtracting the last row's time from Vasya's row and seat. Finally, it prints the result.
