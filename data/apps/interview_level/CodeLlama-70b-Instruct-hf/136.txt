The provided question can be solved using the following Python 3 code:

```py
# Read input for a
a = input()

# Read input for b
b = input()

# Remove leading zeroes from a
a = a.lstrip("0")

# Remove leading zeroes from b
b = b.lstrip("0")

# Check if a and b are equal
if a == b:
    print("=")

# Check if a is greater than b
elif len(a) > len(b) or (len(a) == len(b) and a > b):
    print(">")

# Check if a is less than b
else:
    print("<")
```

This code handles the input and output as specified in the question. It also takes into account the case where leading zeroes are allowed and should be ignored.
