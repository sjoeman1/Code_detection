```python
n, L = map(int, input().split())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the number of bottles of each type that can be bought with the available budget
bottles = {}
for i in range(n):
    bottles[i] = L // (2**i - 1)

# Find the cost of buying the necessary amount of lemonade
total_cost = 0
for i in range(n):
    cost = c[i] * bottles[i]
    total_cost += cost

# Print the total cost
print(total_cost)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the number of types of bottles (n) and the required amount of lemonade (L).
- It then reads the costs of each bottle type (c).
- It calculates the number of bottles of each type that can be bought with the available budget using the formula `bottles[i] = L // (2**i - 1)`.
- It then finds the cost of buying the necessary amount of lemonade by multiplying the cost of each bottle by the number of bottles of that type.
- Finally, the total cost is printed.
