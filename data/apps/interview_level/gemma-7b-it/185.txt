```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Create a list to store the number of stones on each manhole
stones = list(int(input().split()) for _ in range(n))

# Calculate the minimum number of moves
moves = stones[k - 1] + 1  # Move to the first stone on the k-th manhole
moves += sum(stones[0:k - 1])  # Pick up all stones from the first k - 1 manholes
moves += sum(stones[k - 1:])  # Pick up all stones from the remaining manholes

print(moves)
