```python
n, a, x, b, y = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of minutes it takes for each train to reach their finish station
min_a = (x - a) + 1
min_b = (y - b) + 1

# If the minimum number of minutes is the same, it means that Daniel and Vlad will be at the same station at the same time
if min_a == min_b:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
