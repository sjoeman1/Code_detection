```python
a, b = input().split()

# Find the length of the longest common subsequence
lcs_length = len(set(a) & set(b))

# If the length of the longest common subsequence is zero, output -
if lcs_length == 0:
    print("-")

# Otherwise, output the longest common subsequence
else:
    print("".join(set(a) & set(b)))
