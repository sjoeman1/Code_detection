```python
n, t = map(int, input().split())

g = 1
f = 0
a = 0
for i in range(n):
    a += g
    g += 1
    f = max(f, a)

print(f)
```

**Explanation:**

* The variable `n` is the height of the pyramid.
* The variable `t` is the number of seconds.
* The variable `g` is the number of glasses on the top level.
* The variable `f` is the number of completely full glasses.
* The variable `a` is the total number of glasses that have been filled.

The loop iterates over the number of seconds and fills the glasses in the pyramid. The variable `a` is updated to keep track of the total number of glasses that have been filled. The variable `f` is updated to keep track of the number of completely full glasses.

At the end of the loop, the number of completely full glasses is printed.
