```python
n = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(1, int((n+1)**0.5) + 1):
    ans += i
print(ans)
```

**Explanation:**

- We calculate the number of layers by taking the integer division of the square root of N plus 1.
- The number of layers is equal to the number of segments in each layer plus one.
- The formula for the number of segments in a layer is given by the formula:  $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \times layer$
- Therefore, the total number of layers is: $layer = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1$
