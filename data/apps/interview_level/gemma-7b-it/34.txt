```python
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the maximum number of pieces that can be put on each plate
x = min(a, b) // n

# Print the maximum number of pieces
print(x)
```

**Explanation:**

* The input is read and the variables n, a, and b are assigned.
* The maximum number of pieces that can be put on each plate is calculated by dividing the minimum of a and b by n and assigning it to x.
* The maximum number of pieces is printed.
