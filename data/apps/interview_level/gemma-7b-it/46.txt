```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of pairs of integers such that their sum is divisible by 5
pairs = 0
for x in range(1, n + 1):
    for y in range(1, m + 1):
        if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
            pairs += 1

# Print the number of pairs
print(pairs)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads two integers, n and m, from the input.
* It then calculates the number of pairs of integers such that their sum is divisible by 5 using two nested loops over the range 1 to n and 1 to m, respectively.
* If the sum of x and y is divisible by 5, the pair (x, y) is counted.
* Finally, the number of pairs is printed.
