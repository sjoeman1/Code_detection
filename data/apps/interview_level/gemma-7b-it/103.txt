```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()

# Find the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased
erase_count = 0
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i-1] == 1:
        erase_count += 1

# Print the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased
print(erase_count)
