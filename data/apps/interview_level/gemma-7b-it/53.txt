```python
n = int(input())
s = input().lower()
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

m = len(s)
a = list(set(s))

ans = 0
for i in range(m):
    if s[i] not in a:
        a.add(s[i])
        ans += b[i]

print(ans)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code calculates the maximum beauty of t by finding the beauty of each character in the string s that is not yet in the set a.
- The set a keeps track of the characters that have already been used.
- The beauty of a character is added to the total beauty of t if it is not already in a.
- The code then prints the total beauty of t.
