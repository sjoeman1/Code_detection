```python
s = input().strip()

# Check if the input string is an accordion
accordion = bool(s.match("\[:.*:\]"))

# If it is not an accordion, print -1
if not accordion:
    print(-1)

# Otherwise, find the maximum length of the result
else:
    # Calculate the length of the shortest possible accordion
    min_length = len(s) - s.count(")") - s.count("[") - 2

    # Print the maximum length of the result
    print(min_length)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code first checks if the input string `s` is an accordion. It uses the `match()` method to see if the string matches the regular expression for an accordion.
* If `s` is not an accordion, it prints -1.
* Otherwise, it calculates the length of the shortest possible accordion by subtracting the number of closing brackets and opening brackets from the length of `s`.
* The code then prints the maximum length of the result.
