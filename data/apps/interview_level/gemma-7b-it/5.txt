```python
n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())

a = max(l - 1, 0)
b = min(r, n) - 1

print(min(abs(pos - a) + abs(b - pos) + 1, abs(pos - a) + abs(b - pos) + 1))
```

**Explanation:**

* Calculate the minimum and maximum indices of the unclosed tabs, `a` and `b`, respectively.
* Calculate the minimum number of seconds required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r], which is the sum of the absolute differences between the current position and `a`, and `b`, plus 1.
* Print the minimum number of seconds.
