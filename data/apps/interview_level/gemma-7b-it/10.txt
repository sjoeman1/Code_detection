```python
n = int(input())

min_off = n // 5 * 2
max_off = min_off + 2

print(min_off, max_off)
```

**Explanation:**

* We calculate the number of weeks in a year on Mars, which is `n // 5`.
* The number of days off per year is the number of weeks in a year multiplied by 2, which is the number of days off per week.
* The minimum possible number of days off is the number of weeks in a year multiplied by 2.
* The maximum possible number of days off is the number of weeks in a year multiplied by 2 plus 2.

**Time complexity:**

* The code calculates the number of weeks in a year on Mars only once, so the time complexity is O(1).

**Space complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size, so the space complexity is O(1).
