```python
x = int(input())

# Calculate the minimum number of turns
turns = int((x // 90) * 90) + min(x % 90, 90 - x % 90)

# Print the result
print(turns)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the input angle `x`, which represents the camera angle in degrees.
- It calculates the number of complete 90-degree turns that can be made, which is `int(x // 90) * 90` turns.
- It then finds the minimum of the remaining angle (x % 90) and 90 - x % 90. This is the angle that needs to be corrected in the final image.
- Finally, the code adds the number of complete turns and the minimum of the remaining angle to get the total number of turns.
- The code prints the total number of turns.

**Example Usage:**

```
Input:
60

Output:
1

Input:
-60

Output:
3
```

**Output:**

```
