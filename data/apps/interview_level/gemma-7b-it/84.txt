```python
n = int(input())

cost = 0
pairs = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    cost += i
    num_nine = cost // 9
    pairs += num_nine

print(pairs)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of shovels, `n`, from the input.
* It calculates the total cost, `cost`, of each shovel, which is equal to its number.
* The code then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and adds the number of 9s that can be divided by the total cost to the variable `pairs`.
* The number of 9s that can be divided by the total cost is equal to the integer division of the total cost by 9.
* Finally, the code prints the number of pairs.
