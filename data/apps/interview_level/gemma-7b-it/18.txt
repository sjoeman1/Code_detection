```python
s = input().strip()
s_len = len(s)
t = ""
u = ""

for i in range(s_len):
    if s[0] == s[i]:
        t += s[i]
        s = s[1:]
    elif s[i] == s[s_len-1]:
        u += s[i]
        s = s[0:s_len-1]

print(u)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the input string `s`.
2. Initialize two empty strings `t` and `u`.
3. Iterate over the string `s` and perform the following operations:
   - If the first character of `s` is equal to the character at the current position, append the character to the end of `t`.
   - If the character at the end of `t` is equal to the character at the current position, append the character to the end of `u`.
4. Print the resulting string `u`.

**Time Complexity:**

- The loop iterates over the string `s` only once, so the time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the length of `s`.

**Space Complexity:**

- The program uses a constant amount of space regardless of the length of `s`, so the space complexity is O(n) where `n` is the length of `s`.
