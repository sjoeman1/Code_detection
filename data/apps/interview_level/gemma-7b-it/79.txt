```python
import random
m = int(input())
a = []
expectation = 0
while not a:
    x = random.randint(1, m)
    a.append(x)
    expectation += x / gc(a)
print(expectation)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads an integer `m` representing the upper bound of the random number.
* It initializes an empty list `a`.
* It enters a loop until the list `a` is not empty.
* In each iteration, it selects a random integer `x` between 1 and `m`, appends it to `a`, and updates the expectation.
* The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in `a`. If the GCD is 1, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration.
* Finally, the code calculates the expected length of the array as `P/Q` where `P` and `Q` are coprime integers and `Q` is not divisible by 10^9+7. It prints the value of `P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}` as the output.
