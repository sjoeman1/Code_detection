```python
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the total length of wood needed for each door frame
total_length = 2 * a + b

# Divide the total length of wood by the length of each bar to find the number of bars needed
num_bars = total_length // n

# Print the number of bars needed
print(num_bars)
