```python
n, m, a, b = map(int, input().split())

if n % m != 0:
  print(-1)
else:
  boxes = n // m
  burles = boxes * a - boxes * b
  print(burles)
```

**Explanation:**

* Calculate the number of boxes that can be distributed evenly to each delegation (boxes = n // m).
* Calculate the total number of burles spent to build and demolish boxes (burles = boxes * a - boxes * b).
* Print the total number of burles.

**Time Complexity:**

* The code calculates the number of boxes and burles only once, so the time complexity is O(1).

**Space Complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size, so the space complexity is O(1).
