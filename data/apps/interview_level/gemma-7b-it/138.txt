```python
a, b, c, n = map(int, input().split())
n_copybooks = int(n)

# Calculate the number of copybooks that can be bought with the existing copybooks
k = n_copybooks // 4

# Calculate the minimum amount of rubles to buy the required number of copybooks
min_rubles = min(a, b, c) * k

# Print the minimum amount of rubles
print(min_rubles)
