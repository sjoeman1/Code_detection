```python3
k, a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of multiples of k between a and b
num_divisibles = int((b // k - a // k) * k)

# Print the number of k-divisible numbers
print(num_divisibles)
```

**Explanation:**

* Read the input values k, a, and b.
* Calculate the integer division of b by k and a by k using the // operator.
* Subtract the integer division of a by k from the integer division of b by k.
* Multiply the result by k to get the number of multiples of k between a and b.
* Print the number of k-divisible numbers.
