```python

n, k, t = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of standing spectators at time t
standing = 0
for i in range(1, t + 1):
    if i <= k:
        standing += 1
    elif i - k >= 0:
        standing -= 1

print(standing)

```

**Explanation:**

* The loop iterates over the time range from 1 to t.
* If the current time is less than or equal to k, the number of standing spectators increases by one.
* If the current time is greater than k but less than or equal to k + 1, the number of standing spectators decreases by one.
* The total number of standing spectators at time t is stored in the variable standing.
* Finally, the number of standing spectators is printed.
