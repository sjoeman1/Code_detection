```python
x, k = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of dresses in the end of the year
num_ dresses = x * 2 ** (k - 1)

# Subtract the dress eaten by the wardrobe
num_ dresses_remaining = num_ dresses - num_ dresses // 2

# Find the expected number of dresses
expected_num_ dresses = num_ dresses_remaining // 2

# Print the result
print(expected_num_ dresses)
