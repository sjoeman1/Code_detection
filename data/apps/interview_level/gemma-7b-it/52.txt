```python
import math

n = int(input())

if n % 2 == 0:
    m = int(n // 2)
    print(m)
    print(m)
else:
    print(-1)
```

**Explanation:**

* The number of games played in each stage is always even, so the number of teams remaining at each stage is always even.
* When the number of teams remaining is odd, the tournament ends.
* Therefore, the number of teams to invite is the number of teams that will leave an even number of teams remaining at each stage until the final stage.
* The number of games played in each stage is equal to the number of teams remaining in that stage.
* So, the total number of games played is equal to the sum of the number of games played in each stage, which is equal to the number of teams invited.
