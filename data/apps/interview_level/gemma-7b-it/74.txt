```python
n = int(input())
p = []
k = 0
for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
    while n - i * i >= 0:
        p.append(i)
        n -= i
        k += 1
print(k)
print(*p)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code calculates the primes less than or equal to the square root of the input number n.
- It iterates over the primes and adds them to the list p until the sum of the primes is equal to n.
- The number of primes in the representation is stored in k.
- The primes are printed in any order.

**Time Complexity:**

- The code calculates the primes less than or equal to n, which takes O(n) time.
- The loop iterates over the primes only once, so the time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

- The code uses a list p of size O(n) to store the primes.
- The space complexity is O(n).
