```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the number of moves
k = 0
for i in range(len(a) - 1):
    if not (a[i] and a[i + 1] are coprime):
        k += 1
        a.insert(i + 1, int((a[i] * a[i + 1]) // 2)

# Print the number of moves and the new array
print(k)
print(*a)

```

**Explanation:**

- The code calculates the number of moves by iterating over the array and checking if the current number and the next number are co-prime. If they are not, it inserts a number between them that is divisible by both numbers.
- The code uses the `are coprime` function to check if two numbers are co-prime.
- The code inserts a number between two numbers if they are not co-prime.
- The code calculates the new array by inserting the necessary number of elements and prints the new array.
