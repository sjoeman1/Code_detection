```python
n = int(input())

x = -1
y = 0

r = 0
c = 0

for i in range(n):
    r += 1
    c += 1
    if r % 2 == 0:
        x += 1
    if c % 3 == 0:
        y += 1

print(x, y)
```

**Explanation:**
* The number of moves is divided into two groups: the number of moves that increase the row number and the number of moves that increase the column number.
* The number of moves that increase the row number is always even, so the row number increases by one for every two moves.
* The number of moves that increase the column number is always divisible by three, so the column number increases by one for every three moves.
* The initial position of Ayrat is (0, 0).
* Therefore, after n moves, the position of Ayrat is (-1 + n/2) 0, and (n/3) 2.
