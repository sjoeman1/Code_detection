```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

s = a
while s <= 1e9:
    s += c
    if s == b:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

**Explanation:**

- The program reads the input values a, b and c.
- It calculates the sequence S by adding c to the previous element until the sequence reaches a maximum of 1e9.
- If the value of b is found in the sequence S, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
