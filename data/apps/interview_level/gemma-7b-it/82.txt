```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()
total = sum(a)
avg = total // k

min_marks = k - avg

print(min_marks)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the number of marks (n) and the highest possible mark (k).
2. Read n marks received by Noora.
3. Sort the marks in ascending order.
4. Calculate the total marks and divide it by k to get the average mark.
5. Take the integer division of the average mark to get the number of marks that can be achieved with the current marks.
6. Subtract this number from k to get the minimum number of marks that need to be added.
7. Print the minimum number of marks.
