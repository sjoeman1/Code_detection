```python
import sys

# Read input
bessie_grid = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
elsie_grid = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()

# Create grids
bessie_grid_2D = [[int(x) for x in line.split()] for line in bessie_grid.splitlines()]
elsie_grid_2D = [[int(x) for x in line.split()] for line in elsie_grid.splitlines()]

# Check if the grids are the same
is_same = True
for r in range(2):
    for c in range(2):
        if bestie_grid_2D[r][c] != elsie_grid_2D[r][c]:
            is_same = False

# Print the answer
if is_same:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input for both Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles.
* It creates two 2D lists to represent the grids.
* It iterates over the two grids and checks if the tiles are in the same position.
* If the grids are the same, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Time Complexity:**

* The code reads the input twice, so the time complexity is O(n).
* The code iterates over the two grids twice, so the time complexity is O(n).
* Overall, the time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the input.
