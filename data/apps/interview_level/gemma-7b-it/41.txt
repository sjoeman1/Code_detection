```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the index of the nearest zero to each element
d = []
for i in range(len(a)):
    min_distance = float('inf')
    for j in range(len(a)):
        if a[j] == 0 and abs(i - j) < min_distance:
            min_distance = abs(i - j)
    d.append(min_distance)

print(*d)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of elements n and the array a.
* It iterates over the array and finds the nearest zero for each element.
* The distance to the nearest zero is stored in the d list.
* The final d list is printed.

**Time complexity:**

* The code iterates over the array only once, so the time complexity is O(n).

**Space complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the array.
