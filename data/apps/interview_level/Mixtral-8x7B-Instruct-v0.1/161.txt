 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def cat_furrier_transform(x):
    operations = []
    while True:
        if (2 ** int(math.log2(x + 1)) - 1) != x:
            n = int(math.log2(x + 1 - (2 ** int(math.log2(x + 1)))))
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (2 ** n - 1)
        else:
            break
        x += 1
    return operations

x = int(input())
operations = cat_furrier_transform(x)
print(len(operations))
for i in operations[::2]:
    print(i, end=' ')
```

The `cat_furrier_transform` function takes an integer `x` as input and returns a list of integers representing the values of `n` for each Operation A performed in the transformation plan. The function uses a while loop to continuously apply Operations A and B until `x` becomes a perfect longcat.

Inside the while loop, the function first checks if `x` is already a perfect longcat. If it is not, it finds the smallest integer `n` such that `2^n - 1` is not a factor of `x + 1`, and performs Operation A with this value of `n`. Then, it increments `x` by 1 to perform Operation B.

The function continues applying Operations A and B in this alternating pattern until `x` becomes a perfect longcat. It then returns the list of integers `n` used in the Operation A steps.

The main part of the code reads the input integer `x`, calls the `cat_furrier_transform` function to get the list of integers `n`, and prints the length of the list and the values of `n` for the odd-numbered operations.
