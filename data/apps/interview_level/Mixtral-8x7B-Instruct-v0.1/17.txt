 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def solve(n, k, t):
    # Calculate the number of full cycles before t
    cycles = (t - 1) // k

    # Calculate the remaining time after the full cycles
    remaining_time = (t - 1) % k

    # Calculate the number of standing spectators after the full cycles
    standing_spectators_after_cycles = (cycles * k) % n

    # Calculate the number of standing spectators at the remaining time
    standing_spectators_at_remaining_time = remaining_time
    if remaining_time <= k // 2:
        standing_spectators_at_remaining_time = remaining_time + 1
    elif k % 2 == 0 and remaining_time == k // 2 + 1:
        standing_spectators_at_remaining_time = remaining_time - 1

    # Calculate the final answer
    answer = standing_spectators_after_cycles + standing_spectators_at_remaining_time
    if answer > n:
        answer -= n
    return answer

# Test cases
print(solve(10, 5, 3)) # 3
print(solve(10, 5, 7)) # 5
print(solve(10, 5, 12)) # 3
```

The solution works by first calculating the number of full cycles that have passed before time `t`. Each full cycle increases the number of standing spectators by `k` and then decreases it by `k`, so the net effect is zero. Therefore, we only need to consider the number of standing spectators after the full cycles.

Next, we calculate the remaining time after the full cycles. This is the time that the spectators are in the middle of a cycle, so some of them may be standing. We calculate the number of standing spectators at this time by considering the position of the first standing spectator in the current cycle. If this position is less than or equal to `k // 2`, then all spectators in the current cycle are standing. If this position is greater than `k // 2`, then all spectators in the current
