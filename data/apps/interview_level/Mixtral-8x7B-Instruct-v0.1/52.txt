 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def is\_possible(n):
if n & 1:
return False
i = 1
while True:
k = (i * (i - 1)) // 2
if k > n:
break
if k == n:
print(i)
i += 1
if i > n:
return
print(-1)

n = int(input())
is\_possible(n)
```

The function `is_possible` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is possible to have a tournament with exactly `n` games. If `n` is odd, then it is not possible, so the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it uses a while loop to check for all possible values of `i` (starting from 1) if the number of games in a round-robin tournament with `i` teams is equal to `n`. If it finds such a value of `i`, it prints it and continues to the next value. If it has checked all values up to `n` and hasn't found any that work, it prints `-1`.

The main part of the code reads the input value of `n` and calls the `is_possible` function with it.
