 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def max\_chocolates(n, a, b, p, q):
max\_count = 0

# Handling the case when the tile with index divisible by a and b is painted Red
max\_count = (p*(n//a) + q*(n//b)) if (n%a == 0 or n%b == 0) else 0

# Handling the case when the tile with index divisible by a and b is painted Blue
max\_count = max(max\_count, p*(n//a) + q*(n//b - 1) + q*(n//(a*b)) if (n%a == 0 and n%b == 0) else 0)

# Handling the case when the tile with index divisible by a and b is painted Red
max\_count = max(max\_count, p*(n//a - 1) + q*(n//b) + p*q*(n//(a*b)) if (n%a == 0 and n%b != 0) else 0)

# Handling the case when the tile with index divisible by a and b is painted Red
max\_count = max(max\_count, p*(n//a - 1) + q*(n//b - 1) + (p+q)*q*(n//(a*b)) if (n%a != 0 and n%b != 0) else 0)

return max\_count

# Taking input
n, a, b, p, q = map(int, input().split())

# Printing the answer
print(max\_chocolates(n, a, b, p, q))
```

Explanation:

The solution involves checking all the possible cases for painting the tiles and finding the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get in each case. The four cases are:

1. The tile with index divisible by a and b is painted Red.
2. The tile with index divisible by a and b is painted Blue.
3. The tile with index divisible by a is painted Red and the tile with index divisible by b is painted Blue.
4. The tile
