 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def max_sum_digits(x):
    # Generate the number with the maximum sum of digits
    # by repeating the digit 9 as many times as possible
    max_num = int(str(9) * (x // 9))
    
    # If x is not a multiple of 9, add one more 9 to the number
    if x % 9 != 0:
        max_num += 9
    
    return max_num

# Read the input value of x
x = int(input())

# Print the result
print(max_sum_digits(x))
```

This solution works by generating the number with the maximum sum of digits that doesn't exceed x. The number is generated by repeating the digit 9 as many times as possible. If x is not a multiple of 9, then one more 9 is added to the number. The result is then printed to the standard output.
