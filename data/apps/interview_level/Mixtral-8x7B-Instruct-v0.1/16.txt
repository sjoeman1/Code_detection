 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:
```python
def is_regular_bracket_sequence(cnt: list) -> int:
    # Calculate total number of open and close brackets
    open_brackets = cnt[0] + cnt[2]
    close_brackets = cnt[1] + cnt[3]

    # Check if total number of open and close brackets are equal
    if open_brackets != close_brackets:
        return
