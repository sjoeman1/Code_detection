 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())

# Minimum number of days off
min_days_off = n % 7
if min_days_off == 0:
    min_days_off = 7
min_days_off = min_days_off // 2
print(min_days_off, end=' ')

# Maximum number of days off
max_days_off = (n - 1) % 7
if max_days_off == 0:
    max_days_off = 7
max_days_off = max_days_off // 2
print(max_days_off)
```

Explanation:

* The minimum number of days off is either 0 or 7, depending on whether the year starts with a work day or a day off. After that, the minimum number of days off per week is 2.
* The maximum number of days off is determined by the maximum number of consecutive days off that can be squeezed into the year. If the year ends with a work day, then the maximum number of days off is 2; otherwise, the maximum number of days off is 7. After that, the maximum number of days off per week is 2.

The code calculates the minimum and maximum number of days off based on these rules. Note that the `%` operator calculates the remainder of division, and the `//` operator calculates integer division.
