 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n, a, x, b, y = map(int, input().split())

# Check if Daniel and Vlad ever meet on the circle line
if (a + x - b) % n == 0 or (b + y - a) % n == 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

The solution checks if the difference between the starting stations of Daniel and Vlad is a multiple of the number of stations `n` or if the difference between the starting stations of Vlad and Daniel is a multiple of `n`. If either of these conditions is true, then Daniel and Vlad will meet on the circle line.

The solution works because the two routes in the subway are parallel and have a fixed distance between them. If the difference between the starting stations of Daniel and Vlad is a multiple of `n`, then Daniel and Vlad will always be the same number of stations apart, and they will meet at some point on the circle line. Similarly, if the difference between the starting stations of Vlad and Daniel is a multiple of `n`, then they will also meet at some point on the circle line.

The solution handles the case when Daniel or Vlad exit the subway when their train reaches their finish station. In this case, they are considered to be at the same station at the moment they exit the subway.
