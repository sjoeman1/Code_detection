 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min_cost(n, a, b, c):
    # Calculate the minimum number of copybooks needed to make n+k divisible by 4
    k = (4 - (n % 4)) % 4

    # Calculate the minimum cost to buy k copybooks
    cost = min(k * a, (k // 2) * b, (k // 3) * c)

    return cost

# Test cases
print(min_cost(1, 1, 3, 4)) # 3
print(min_cost(6, 2, 1, 1)) # 1
print(min_cost(4, 4, 4, 4)) # 0
print(min_cost(999999999, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)) # 1000000000
```

The `min_cost` function calculates the minimum number of copybooks needed to make `n+k` divisible by 4, and then calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` copybooks using the three types of packs available. The minimum cost is the minimum of `k * a`, `(k // 2) * b`, and `(k // 3) * c`, which correspond to buying `k` single copybooks, `k // 2` packs of two copybooks, and `k // 3` packs of three copybooks, respectively. The `//` operator is used for integer division.
