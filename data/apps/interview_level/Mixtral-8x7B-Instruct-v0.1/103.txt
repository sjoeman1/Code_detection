 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Check if the first element can be erased
if a[1] - a[0] > 1:
    print(1)
else:
    # Find the length of the longest sequence of equal or increasing differences
    diff = a[1] - a[0]
    count = 2
    for i in range(2, n):
        if a[i] - a[i-1] == diff:
            count += 1
        elif a[i] - a[i-1] > diff:
            diff = a[i] - a[i-1]
            count = 2

    print(count)
```

The solution works by first checking if the first element can be erased. If the difference between the second and the first element is greater than 1, then the first element can be erased. Otherwise, the solution finds the length of the longest sequence of equal or increasing differences between consecutive elements. This is done by initializing a difference variable with the difference between the first two elements, and a count variable with 2. The solution then iterates over the rest of the elements, updating the difference variable if the difference between the current and the previous element is greater than the current difference, and updating the count variable if the difference between the current and the previous element is equal to the current difference. Finally, the solution prints the count variable, which is the length of the longest sequence of equal or increasing differences. This is also the maximum number of consecutive elements that JATC can erase.
