 Here is a Python3 code that can solve the problem:
```python
import re

def check_password(password):
    if len(password) < 5:
        return "Too weak"
    elif not re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) or not re.search(r'[a-z]', password) or not re.search(r'\d', password):
        return "Too weak"
    else:
        return "Correct"

# Test the function
password = input()
print(check_password(password))
```
Explanation:

* The function `check_password` takes a string `password` as input and returns "Correct" if the password meets all the conditions, and "Too weak" otherwise.
* The first condition is checked using the `len` function.
* The other three conditions are checked using regular expressions.
* The `re.search` function returns a match object if there is a match anywhere in the string, and `None` otherwise.
* If any of the conditions are not met, the function immediately returns "Too weak".
* If all the conditions are met, the function returns "Correct".
* The last two lines of the code take user input for the password and print the result of the function.
