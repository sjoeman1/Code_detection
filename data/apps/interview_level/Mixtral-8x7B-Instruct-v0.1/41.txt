 Here is a Python3 solution using two pointers technique:
```python
n = int(input().strip())
a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

left, right = 0, 0
result = []
while left < n or right < n:
    if left < n and a[left] != 0:
        left += 1
    elif right < n and a[right] == 0:
        result.append(right - left)
        right += 1
    else:
        right += 1

print(*result)
```
Explanation:

* Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the beginning of the array.
* If `left` is not at the end of the array and the current element is not 0, move `left` to the next element.
* If `right` is not at the end of the array and the current element is 0, calculate the distance between `left` and `right` and add it to the result list, then move `right` to the next element.
* If both `left` and `right` are at the end of the array or the current element is 0, move `right` to the next element.
* Repeat the above steps until both pointers are at the end of the array.
* Finally, print the result list.

Note: The `strip()` method is used to remove the whitespaces from the input string and `split()` method is used to split the string into a list of strings using a single space as a separator.
