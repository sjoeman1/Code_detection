 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import math

def min_norm(a, b):
    # calculate the norm of A
    norm_A = max(abs(a[0]), abs(a[1]), abs(b[0]), abs(b[1]))

    # if A is already degenerate, then the answer is 0
    if a[0]*b[1] - a[1]*b[0] == 0:
        return 0

    # calculate the determinant of A
    det_A = a[0]*b[1] - a[1]*b[0]

    # the minimum possible norm of A - B is the absolute value of the determinant
    return abs(det_A)

# read input
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

# print the result
print(min_norm(a, b))
```

The solution first calculates the norm of the input matrix A. If A is already degenerate, then the answer is 0. Otherwise, the solution calculates the determinant of A and returns its absolute value as the minimum possible norm of A - B. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix can be calculated as `a[0]*b[1] - a[1]*b[0]`.
