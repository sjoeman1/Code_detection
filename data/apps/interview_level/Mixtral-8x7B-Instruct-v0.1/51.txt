 Here's a Python3 solution for the problem you provided. This code reads the input string `t`, then checks for possible errors and outputs the result accordingly.

```python
def find_overlap(t):
    for i in range(1, len(t)):
        if t[:i] == t[i:i+i]:
            return i
    return 0

def main():
    t = input()
    n = find_overlap(t)
    if n == 0:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(t[:-n])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines two functions: `find_overlap` and `main`.

- `find_overlap` takes the input string `t` and checks for possible overlaps. It returns the length of the overlap if there is one, and 0 otherwise.
- `main` reads the input string, calls `find_overlap` and checks its output. Depending on the result, it prints "NO" or "YES" followed by the possible message, as specified in the problem statement.

You can test this code using the examples provided in the problem statement. Just copy and paste the input strings, and check the output.
