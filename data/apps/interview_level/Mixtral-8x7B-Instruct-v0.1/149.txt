 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def is\_unlucky(x, y, n):
for a in range(1 + int(n**0.5)):
for b in range(1 + int(n**0.5)):
if a*a + b*b == n:
return True
return False

def golden\_age(x, y, l, r):
n = l
while is\_unlucky(x, y, n):
n += 1
if n > r:
return 0

res = 0
while n <= r:
res += 1
n += 1
while n <= r and not is\_unlucky(x, y, n):
n += 1
return res

x, y, l, r = map(int, input().split())
print(golden\_age(x, y, l, r))
```

The function `is_unlucky` checks if a given year `n` is unlucky or not by checking if it can be represented as `x^a + y^b` for some non-negative integers `a` and `b`.

The function `golden_age` finds the maximum length of The Golden Age which starts no earlier than the year `l` and ends no later than the year `r`. It does this by first finding the smallest unlucky year `n` starting from `l`, and then counting the number of consecutive golden years until it reaches an unlucky year or exceeds `r`. The function returns `0` if all years in the interval `[l, r]` are unlucky.
