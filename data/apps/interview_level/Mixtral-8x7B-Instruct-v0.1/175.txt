 Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
def process(a, b):
    while a > 0 and b > 0:
        if a >= 2*b:
            a -= 2*b
        else:
            b -= 2*a
    return a, b

# Read input values for a and b
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Perform the sequence of actions and print the final values of a and b
print(*process(a, b))
```

To use this code, simply run it in a Python3 environment and input the initial values of `a` and `b` separated by a space. The code will output the final values of `a` and `b` after the process ends.
