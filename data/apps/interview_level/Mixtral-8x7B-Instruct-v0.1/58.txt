 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

# Calculate the total length of the sides of the frames
total_length = 2 * 2 * a + 2 * b

# Calculate the number of wooden bars needed
num_bars = total_length // n

# If there is any leftover length, add one more bar
if total_length % n != 0:
    num_bars += 1

print(num_bars)
```

The solution first calculates the total length of the sides of the frames for two doors, which is `2 * 2 * a` for the four vertical sides and `2 * b` for the two horizontal sides. Then, it calculates the number of wooden bars needed to make the frames by dividing the total length by the length of each wooden bar, `n`. If there is any leftover length, the solution adds one more bar to the total. Finally, the solution prints the number of wooden bars needed.
