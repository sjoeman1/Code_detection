 Here is one way to solve the problem using Python:
```
l, r, a = map(int, input().split())

# The total number of players that can be included in the team
# is limited by the number of left-handers and right-handers
# since ambidexters can play with either hand
total = min(l, r)

# If the number of ambidexters is odd, then the team size must be even
# and therefore cannot be equal to the total number of left-handers and right-handers
if a % 2 == 1:
    total -= 1

# The number of left-handers and right-handers that can be included
# in the team is half of the minimum of the two
left_right = total // 2

# The number of ambidexters that can be included in the team
# is the same as the number of left-handers and right-handers
ambidexters = total // 2

# The final team size is the sum of the number of left-handers,
# right-handers, and ambidexters
team_size = 2 * left_right + 2 * ambidexters

print(team_size)
```
This code first reads the number of left-handers, right-handers, and ambidexters from standard input. It then calculates the maximum number of players that can be included in the team, which is limited by the number of left-handers and right-handers. If the number of ambidexters is odd, then the team size must be even, so the total number of players is reduced by 1. The number of left-handers and right-handers that can be included in the team is half of the minimum of the two, and the number of ambidexters that can be included in the team is the same as the number of left-handers and right-handers. Finally, the code calculates the final team size by summing the number of left-handers, right-handers, and ambidexters, and prints the result.
