 To solve this problem, we need to place the `k` fishes in the pond such that no matter where we place the scoop-net, we maximize the expected number of fishes caught.

First, let's calculate the total number of possible positions to place the scoop-net. This is equal to `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

Next, for each cell in the pond, let's calculate the number of positions the scoop-net can be placed such that the cell is inside the scoop-net. This is equal to `(r - 1)^2`.

Therefore, to maximize the expected number of fishes caught, we should place the fishes in the `k` cells that have the highest number of positions the scoop-net can be placed such that the cell is inside the scoop-net.

Here's the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
def max\_expected\_fishes(n, m, r, k):
n, m, r, k = map(int, [n, m, r, k])

# Calculate the total number of possible positions to place the scoop-net
total\_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)

# Create a list to store the number of positions the scoop-net can be placed
# such that the cell is inside the scoop-net
cell\_positions = [(r - 1)**2 for _ in range(n*m)]

# Place the fishes in the k cells with the highest number of positions
# the scoop-net can be placed such that the cell is inside the scoop-net
fishes = [cell\_positions.pop(max\_index) for _ in range(k)]

# Calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes
max\_expected = sum(fishes) / total\_positions

# Return the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes
return max\_expected

# Test the function
print(max\_expected\_fishes(3, 3, 2, 3)) # 2.0000000000
print(max\_expected\_fishes(12
