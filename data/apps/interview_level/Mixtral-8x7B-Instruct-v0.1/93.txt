 Here's a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def find_next_states(state):
    next_states = []
    for i in range(3):
        next_row = [state[0][i], state[0][(i+1)%3], state[1][i], state[1][(i+1)%3]]
        next_states.append((''.join(next_row), i))
    return next_states

def solve(state1, state2):
    states1, states2 = {state1}, {state2}
    while True:
        new_states1 = set()
        for state, direction in states1:
            next_states = find_next_states(state)
            for next_state, next_direction in next_states:
                if next_state in states2:
                    return True, direction, next_direction
                new_states1.add((next_state, (direction + 2 + next_direction) % 4))
        if not new_states1:
            break
        states1 = new_states1

    return False, -1, -1

def main():
    state1 = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(2)]
    state2 = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(2)]

    result, direction1, direction2 = solve(tuple([''.join(row) for row in state1]), tuple([''.join(row) for row in state2]))

    if result:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `find_next_states` function generates all possible next states from the given state by sliding the tiles. The `solve` function finds the solution using BFS (Breadth-First Search) and returns the boolean result and directions to move for both Bessie and Elsie. The `main` function reads the input and calls the `solve` function and prints the result accordingly.
