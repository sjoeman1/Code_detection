 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0
product = 1
for i in a:
    product *= i
    if product % k == 0:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

The solution is based on the observation that if there is a sequence of consecutive numbers that results in a product divisible by `k`, then any subsequence of that sequence will also result in a product divisible by `k`. Therefore, we only need to check if the product of all numbers in the sequence is divisible by `k`, and if so, count all the subsequences of that sequence as valid.

The code first reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input, and then reads the sequence of numbers `a` from the second line of the input. It initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of valid subsequences. It also initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to compute the product of all numbers in the sequence.

The code then iterates over the sequence of numbers `a`, and for each number `i`, it updates the value of `product` by multiplying it with `i`. If `product` is divisible by `k`, then the code increments the value of `count` by 1.

After iterating over all numbers in the sequence, the code prints the value of `count`, which represents the number of valid subsequences.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the sequence, and the space complexity is O(1), as the solution only uses a constant amount of extra space.
