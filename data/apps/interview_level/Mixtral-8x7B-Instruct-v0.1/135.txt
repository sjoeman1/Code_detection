 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
remainders = set()

for i in range(1, k+1):
    rem = n % i
    if rem in remainders:
        print("No")
        break
    else:
        remainders.add(rem)
else:
    print("Yes")
```

In this solution, we take the input `n` and `k` as integers and convert them into a set of remainders called `remainders`. We then iterate from `1` to `k` and calculate the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If this remainder is already in the `remainders` set, we print "No" and break the loop. Otherwise, we add the remainder to the set. If we have checked all the remainders and haven't broken the loop, we print "Yes".
