 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

for x in range(n//a + 1):
    y = (n - x*a) // b
    if x*a + y*b == n:
        print("YES")
        print(x, y)
        break
else:
    print("NO")
```

The solution uses a simple loop to iterate through all possible values of `x` (number of bottles of Ber-Cola) and calculates the corresponding value of `y` (number of Bars bars) using the equation `x*a + y*b = n`. If a solution is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and breaks out of the loop. If no solution is found after checking all possible values of `x`, it prints "NO".
