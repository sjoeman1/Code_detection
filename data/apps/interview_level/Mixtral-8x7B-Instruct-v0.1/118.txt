 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def pineapple\_bark(t, s, x):
if x < t:
return "NO"
else:
return "YES" if (x - t) % s < 2 else "NO"

# Test cases
print(pineapple\_bark(3, 10, 4)) # NO
print(pineapple\_bark(3, 10, 3)) # YES
print(pineapple\_bark(3, 8, 51)) # YES
print(pineapple\_bark(3, 8, 52)) # YES
```

The function `pineapple_bark` takes in three integers `t`, `s`, and `x` as input, which represent the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple, respectively. It returns a string "YES" if the pineapple will bark at time `x` or a string "NO" otherwise.

The function first checks if `x` is less than `t`, in which case it returns "NO" since the pineapple has not barked yet. Otherwise, it checks if `(x - t) % s` is less than 2, which means that the pineapple will bark at time `x`. If so, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO".

The function is then tested with the provided test cases, and it returns the expected output for each case.
