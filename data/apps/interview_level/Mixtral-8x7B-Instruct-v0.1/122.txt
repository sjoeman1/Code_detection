 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

left_sum = 0
right_sum = sum(a)

for i in range(n):
    right_sum -= a[i]
    if left_sum == right_sum:
        print("YES")
        break
    left_sum += a[i]
else:
    print("NO")
```

The solution works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the sum of elements on the left and right sides of the current element. If at any point the sum of elements on the left side is equal to the sum of elements on the right side, then Vasya can divide the array after moving the current element to that position. If the loop ends without finding such a position, then it's not possible to divide the array.
