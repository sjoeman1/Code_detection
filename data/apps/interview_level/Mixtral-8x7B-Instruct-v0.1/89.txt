 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min_layers(n):
    # Initialize the result as 0
    res = 0

    # Initialize two pointers i and j
    i, j = 0, 0

    # Keep incrementing j until it becomes greater than n
    while j <= n:

        # Increment the result
        res += 1

        # Initialize the max endpoint of the current layer as i
        max_endpoint = i

        # Keep incrementing i until it becomes greater than j or the
        # max endpoint of the current layer becomes less than or equal
        # to j
        while i <= j and max_endpoint <= j:
            max_endpoint = n - (j - i)
            i += 1

        # Update j
        j = max_endpoint

    # Return the result
    return res

# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Print the result
print(min_layers(n))
```

This solution uses a simple greedy algorithm to solve the problem. At each step, it increments the right endpoint `j` until it becomes greater than `n`. For each `j`, it calculates the maximum endpoint of the current layer by subtracting the difference between `j` and the current left endpoint `i` from `n`. It then increments the left endpoint `i` until the maximum endpoint of the current layer becomes less than or equal to `j`. The algorithm repeats this process until the right endpoint becomes greater than `n`. The number of layers required is then equal to the number of iterations of the while loop.

The solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(1). This is because the algorithm performs two nested loops, and the variables used in the algorithm have a constant size.
