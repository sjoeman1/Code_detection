 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def solve():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y:
        return '+'
    elif x < y:
        return '-'
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        return '0'
    else:
        return '?'

# In the following code, the function solve() is called and the result is printed.
print(solve())
```

The function `solve()` takes three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input, representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, and have an unknown vote, respectively. It first checks if there is a clear winner between upvotes and downvotes. If `x` is greater than `y`, it returns '+', indicating that there are more upvotes than downvotes. If `x` is less than `y`, it returns '-', indicating that there are more downvotes than upvotes. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, it returns '0', indicating that there is a tie with no unknown votes. In all other cases, it returns '?', indicating that the result is uncertain.

In the main part of the code, the function `solve()` is called with the input values and the result is printed.
