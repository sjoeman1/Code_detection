 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def check_win(board, player):
    n = 4
    # Check rows and columns
    for i in range(n):
        if all(board[j][i] == player for j in range(n)) or all(board[i][j] == player for j in range(n)):
            return True
    # Check diagonals
    if all(board[i][i] == player for i in range(n)) or all(board[i][n-i-1] == player for i in range(n)):
        return True
    return False

def tic_tac_toe():
    board = [input() for _ in range(4)]
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            if board[i][j] == '.':
                board[i][j] = 'x'
                if check_win(board, 'x'):
                    print('YES')
                    return
                board[i][j] = '.'

    print('NO')

tic_tac_toe()
```

The solution checks all possible winning positions for Ilya (X) after placing X in each empty cell. If there is a winning position, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function `check_win()` checks if there is a win for a given player in the board. It checks rows, columns, and diagonals.
