 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def is\_lucky(n):
if n < 0:
n = -n
return any(int(digit) == 0 or sum(int(digit) == 9 for digit in str(n)) <= 1
for digit in str(n))

n = int(input())
years = 0
while True:
years += 1
if is\_lucky(n + years):
print(years)
break
```

The function `is_lucky` checks if a given year is lucky or not. It does this by converting the year to a string, and then checking if any digit is 0 or if there is at most one digit that is not 0 and not 9.

The main part of the solution is a loop that increments the year by 1 and checks if the result is lucky. If it is, the loop breaks and the number of years is printed.
