 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem. The solution is based on the observation that for a rectangle to be possible with the given lengths, the lengths must be two pair of same elements. Also, the sum of the lengths must be even and the lengths themselves must be even. The code checks for these conditions and calculates the answer accordingly.
```python
def is_valid(x):
    # checks if x is a valid rectangle
    return x % 2 == 0 and x // 2 % 2 == 0

def count_ways(n):
    # count the number of ways to split the stick
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        if is_valid(a) and is_valid(n - 2 * a):
            count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(count_ways(n))
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). The solution iterates through all possible values of `a` and checks if `a` and `n - 2*a` form a valid rectangle. If yes, it increments the count of ways. Finally, it prints the count.
