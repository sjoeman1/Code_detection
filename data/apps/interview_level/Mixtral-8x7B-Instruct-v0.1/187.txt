 Here is one way to solve the problem using Python:

```python
n = int(input())
nums = set(map(int, input().split()))

for num in nums:
    if num * 2 == n:
        print("YES")
        print(num, num)
        break
    elif num * 2 > n and num not in nums - {num for num in nums if num * 2 <= n}:
        print("YES")
        print(num, list(nums - {num})[0])
        break
else:
    print("NO")
```

This code first reads the number of cards `n` and the list of numbers on the cards. It then checks if there is a number `num` that appears exactly `n / 2` times in the list. If so, it prints "YES" and the number that Petya and Vasya should choose.

If not, it checks if there is a number `num` that appears at least once and such that `num * 2 > n` and `(n - num)` does not appear in the list. If so, it prints "YES" and the number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose.

If neither of these conditions is satisfied, it prints "NO".

Here is how the code works on the given examples:

Example 1:

* `n` is 4
* `nums` is the set `{11, 27}`
* The code checks if there is a number that appears exactly 2 times in the list. It finds that `11` appears 2 times, so it prints "YES" and the numbers `11` and `27`

Example 2:

* `n` is 2
* `nums` is the set `{6, 6}`
* The code checks if there is a number that appears exactly 1 time in the list. It does not find such a number, so it checks if there is a number that appears at least once and such that `num * 2 > n` and `(n - num)` does not appear in the list. It does not find such a number, so it prints "NO"
