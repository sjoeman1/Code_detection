 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def is_divisible_by_64(s):
    # Count the number of consecutive zeros at the end of the string
    zeros_count = 0
    while s[-1] == '0':
        zeros_count += 1
        s = s[:-1]
    
    # Check if the remaining string represents a number divisible by 64 in binary
    if int(s, 2) % 8 == 0 and zeros_count >= 3:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Read the input string
s = input()

# Check if the string can be modified to represent a number divisible by 64
if is_divisible_by_64(s):
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')
```

The `is_divisible_by_64` function checks if a binary string can be modified to represent a number divisible by 64. It does this by first counting the number of consecutive zeros at the end of the string. Then, it checks if the remaining string represents a number that is divisible by 8 in decimal (which is equivalent to being divisible by 64 in binary). If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The main part of the code reads the input string, checks if it can be modified to represent a number divisible by 64 using the `is_divisible_by_64` function, and prints the answer accordingly.
