 Here is a Python3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def min\_time\_to\_post\_office(d, k, a, b, t):
time = 0
dist\_driven = 0
while dist\_driven < d:
time += a
dist\_driven += 1
if dist\_driven == k:
time += t
dist\_driven = 0
if dist\_driven + k >= d:
time += (d - dist\_driven) * b
break
return time

d, k, a, b, t = map(int, input().split())
print(min\_time\_to\_post\_office(d, k, a, b, t))
```

The function `min_time_to_post_office` takes in the parameters `d`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `t` and calculates the minimum time it takes for Vasiliy to reach the post office.

The function starts by initializing `time` to 0 and `dist_driven` to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `dist_driven` is less than `d`.

Inside the while loop, the function first increments `time` by `a` to account for the time it takes to drive 1 kilometer. It then increments `dist_driven` by 1 to account for the fact that Vasiliy has driven 1 kilometer further.

If `dist_driven` is equal to `k`, it means that the car has broken down and needs to be repaired. The function increments `time` by `t` to account for the time it takes to repair the car. It then resets `dist_driven` to 0, since Vasiliy has started driving again from the beginning.

If `dist_driven` plus `k` is greater than or equal to `d`, it means that Vasiliy has driven far enough to reach the post office on foot. The function increments `time` by the remaining distance multiplied by `b` to account for the time it takes to walk the rest of the way.

Once the while loop is finished, the function returns `time`.

The last two lines of the code read in the input values for `d`, `k`, `
