 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def get_min_replacements(ticket: str) -> int:
    # Calculate the sum of the first three and the last three digits
    first_half_sum = sum(map(int, ticket[:3]))
    second_half_sum = sum(map(int, ticket[3:]))

    # If the sums are already equal, then no replacements are needed
    if first_half_sum == second_half_sum:
        return 0

    # Initialize the minimum number of replacements to 3 (as at least one digit in each half needs to be changed)
    min_replacements = 3

    # Iterate over all possible replacement digits
    for replacement_digit in range(10):
        # Calculate the new sum of the first three digits if the replacement digit is used
        new_first_half_sum = sum(map(int, (ticket[:3] if ticket[i] != str(replacement_digit) else "0"*3) for i in range(3)))

        # Calculate the number of replacements needed if the replacement digit is used
        replacements_needed = abs(new_first_half_sum - second_half_sum)

        # Update the minimum number of replacements if fewer replacements are needed
        min_replacements = min(min_replacements, 3 + replacements_needed)

    return min_replacements

# Test cases
print(get_min_replacements("000000"))  # 0
print(get_min_replacements("123456"))  # 2
print(get_min_replacements("111000"))  # 1
```

The `get_min_replacements` function first calculates the sum of the first three and the last three digits of the ticket. If they are already equal, then no replacements are needed.

Otherwise, it initializes the minimum number of replacements to 3 (as at least one digit in each half needs to be changed). It then
