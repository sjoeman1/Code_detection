 Here is one way to solve the problem using Python3:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the minimum hours required to water the garden
min_hours = k

# Iterate through the buckets
for i in range(n):
  # Calculate the remainder when the garden length is divided by the bucket's length
  rem = k % a[i]

  # If the remainder is 0, then the bucket can water the entire garden
  if rem == 0:
    # Calculate the number of hours required to water the garden
    hours = k // a[i]
    # Update the minimum hours required to water the garden
    min_hours = min(min_hours, hours)

  # If the remainder is not 0, then the bucket cannot water the entire garden
  # but it can water a subsegment of length a[i]-rem
  elif rem != 0:
    # Calculate the number of hours required to water the garden
    hours = (k - rem) // a[i] + 1
    # Update the minimum hours required to water the garden
    min_hours = min(min_hours, hours)

# Print the minimum number of hours required to water the garden
print(min_hours)
```

The algorithm works by iterating through the buckets and calculating the number of hours required to water the garden using each bucket. For each bucket, it calculates the remainder when the garden length is divided by the bucket's length. If the remainder is 0, then the bucket can water the entire garden, and the number of hours required to water the garden is simply the garden length divided by the bucket's length. If the remainder is not 0, then the bucket cannot water the entire garden, but it can water a subsegment of length equal to the bucket's length minus the remainder. In this case, the number of hours required to water the garden is the length of the subsegment divided by the bucket's length, plus 1. The algorithm keeps track of the minimum number of hours required to water the garden, and prints this value at the end.
