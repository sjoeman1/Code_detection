 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem. The idea is to use a greedy approach where we always move to the next smallest number that can be reached in one move. If no such number can be reached, we replace the current piece with one that can reach the next smallest number.

We use a set to keep track of the numbers that have been visited and a dictionary to keep track of the current position of each piece. We also keep track of the number of steps taken and the number of replacements made.

At each step, we find the next smallest unvisited number and try to move to it with the current piece. If it is not possible, we replace the current piece with another one and try again. If it is still not possible, we move to any unvisited number that can be reached with the current piece. If no such number exists, we have reached a dead end and backtrack.
