 Here is a possible solution for the problem:

```python
def lara_position(n, m, k):
    # Lara starts at position (1, 1)
    x, y = 1, 1
    # She moves n-1 steps down and then m-1 steps to the right
    steps_down = (n - 1) // 2
    steps_right = m - 1
    # We count how many steps Lara has made so far
    steps = 0
    while steps + 1 < k + 1:
        # If Lara has not reached the bottom row yet
        if x < n and steps < steps_down:
            # She moves down
            x += 1
            steps += 1
        # If Lara has reached the bottom row and has not moved to the right end of it yet
        elif x == n and steps < steps_down + steps_right:
            # She moves right
            y += 1
            steps += 1
        # If Lara has moved to the right end of the bottom row
        elif x == n and steps == steps_down + steps_right:
            # She moves up
            x -= 1
            y -= 1
            steps_right -= 1
            steps += 1
        # If Lara has moved to the left end of some row
        elif y == 1 and x > 1 and steps < k:
            # She moves up
            x -= 1
            y += 1
            steps += 1
    return x, y

# Test the function
print(lara_position(4, 3, 0))  # (1, 1)
print(lara_position(4, 3, 11))  # (1, 2)
print(lara_position(4, 3, 7))   # (3, 2)
```

The function `lara_position` takes as input the dimensions of the dungeon `n` and `m`, and the number of steps `k` that Lara has made so far. It returns a tuple representing the current position of Lara in the dungeon.

The function first initializes the starting position of Lara to be
