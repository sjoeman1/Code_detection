 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
print(abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1))
```

This solution works by calculating the absolute difference between the final and initial coordinates for both x and y. The sum of these two values gives the minimal number of steps the robot needs to take to reach the final position.
