 Here is the Python 3 code for the question:

```py
def max_hangout_days(N, M, A):
    # Check if all assignments can be completed within the vacation days
    if N < sum(A):
        return -1

    # Sort the assignment days in ascending order
    A.sort()

    # Initialize the number of hangout days
    hangout_days = 0

    # Iterate over all assignments
    for i in range(M):
        # Calculate the number of days to hangout between assignments
        hangout_days += A[i] - 1

    # Subtract the number of assignment days
    hangout_days -= sum(A)

    # Return the maximum number of hangout days
    return hangout_days


# Read input from the user
N, M = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the maximum number of hangout days
hangout_days = max_hangout_days(N, M, A)

# Print the result
print(hangout_days)
```

In this code, we define a function `max_hangout_days` which takes three arguments: the number of vacation days (`N`), the number of assignments (`M`), and a list of assignment days (`A`).

We first check if all assignments can be completed within the vacation days by comparing `N` with the sum of the assignment days. If `N` is less than the sum, we return `-1` as there is no solution.

Next, we sort the assignment days in ascending order to make it easier to calculate the hangout days.

We initialize the number of hangout days to 0. Then, we iterate over all assignments, and for each assignment, we calculate the number of days to hangout between assignments. We subtract 1 from the assignment days because we don't want to count the day when the assignment is done.

Finally, we subtract the sum of the assignment days from the hangout days to compensate for the assignment days.

We return the maximum number of hangout days from the `max_hangout_days` function.
