Here is the Python3 code for the question:

```
def is_palindrome(s):
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = input()
    result = is_palindrome(s)
    print(result)
```

In this code:

*   We define a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string as input.
*   We check if the string is equal to its reverse using the `==` operator.
*   If it is a palindrome, we return "Yes"
*   If it is not a palindrome, we return "No"
*   We then take user input and store it in the variable `s`.
*   Finally, we call the `is_palindrome` function with `s` as the input and print the result.
