The following Python3 code should solve the problem:

```py
a = int(input())
result = (2**a) - 1
print(result)
```

The first line reads the input and converts it to an integer. The second line calculates the result using the formula `2^a - 1` and stores it in the `result` variable. The third line prints the result.
