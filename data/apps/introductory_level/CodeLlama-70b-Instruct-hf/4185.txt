Here is the Python3 code for solving the given problem:

```
def solution(n, m, matrix):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if matrix[i][j] != i * m + j + 1:
                count += 1
    return count


n, m = map(int, input().split())
matrix = []
for _ in range(n):
    matrix.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
print(solution(n, m, matrix))
```

This code reads the input, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. It then reads the matrix and calculates the number of cells that are not in the correct position. Finally, it prints the count.
