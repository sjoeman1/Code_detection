This code uses a stack to solve the problem. It iterates through the string `s`, pushing the indices of the `0`s into the stack. When it encounters a `1`, it removes two adjacent cubes, and the cubes on top of them fall down. This is simulated by popping the top of the stack and adding `1` to the answer. If the stack is not empty, it pushes the current index `i` into the stack. If the stack is not empty after the loop, it adds the length of the stack to the answer.
