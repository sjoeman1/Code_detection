Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```
import sys

# Function to convert an integer to a Brainfuck code that outputs it
def convert_int_to_bf(num):
    # Initialize the Brainfuck code
    bf_code = ""
    # Loop through the digits of the integer
    for digit in str(num):
        # Add the required number of + signs to increase the cell value by the digit
        bf_code += "+" * int(digit)
        # Append a . to output the cell value
        bf_code += "."
    return bf_code

# Function to generate the Brainfuck code for the expression
def generate_bf_code(expression):
    # Split the expression into operands and operators
    operands = expression.split("+")
    # Initialize the Brainfuck code
    bf_code = ""
    # Loop through the operands
    for operand in operands:
        # Convert the operand to Brainfuck code
        bf_code += convert_int_to_bf(operand)
        # Append a > to move to the next cell
        bf_code += ">"
    # Append a < to move back to the first cell
    bf_code += "<"
    # Loop through the operands
    for operand in operands:
        # Append a [<->-] to subtract the current cell value from the result cell
        bf_code += "[<->-]"
        # Append a < to move back to the previous cell
        bf_code += "<"
    # Append a +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++. to output the result
    bf_code += "++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++."
    return bf_code

# Read the input expression from stdin
expression = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
# Generate the Brainfuck code for the expression
bf_code = generate_bf_code(expression)
# Print the Brainfuck code
print(bf_code)
```
