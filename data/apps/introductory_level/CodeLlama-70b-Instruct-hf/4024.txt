The solution for this problem is as follows:

```
a = int(input())

result = 0
while a > 1:
    if a % 2 == 0:
        a = a // 2
    else:
        a = (a - 1) // 2
    result += 1
print(result)
```

In this solution, we take the input as an integer `a`. We initialize the result variable as 0. Then, we use a while loop to keep dividing `a` by 2 until it becomes 1. If `a` is even, we divide it by 2. If `a` is odd, we subtract 1 from it and then divide it by 2. Each time we perform one of these operations, we increment the result by 1. Finally, we print the result.
