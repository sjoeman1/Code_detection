Here is the Python3 code for the given question:

```python
# Take input from user
n = int(input("Enter the number of shift: "))
s = input("Enter the string: ")

# Create a dictionary for mapping of alphabets
alphabets = {chr(ord('A') + i): chr(ord('A') + (i + n) % 26) for i in range(26)}

# Shift each character of the string
result = ''.join([alphabets[char] for char in s])

# Print the resulting string
print("Resultant string:", result)
```



The first line takes the input for the number of shifts, N, and the second line takes the input for the string, S.

The alphabets dictionary is created to map each alphabet to its shifted value. The resultant string is created by joining the shifted characters.

Finally, the resultant string is printed.
