Here is the Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```
from collections import defaultdict


def solve(n, segments):
    """
    Find the maximum possible length of the intersection of n - 1 segments
    after removing one segment.

    Args:
        n: the number of segments
        segments: a list of tuples representing the segments

    Returns:
        the maximum possible length of the intersection of n - 1 segments
    """
    # Create a dictionary to store the number of times a point is visited
    points = defaultdict(int)

    # Add the endpoints of each segment to the dictionary
    for segment in segments:
        points[segment[0]] += 1
        points[segment[1] + 1] -= 1

    # Sort the points by their position
    points = sorted(points.items())

    # Calculate the prefix sum of the number of visits
    for i in range(1, len(points)):
        points[i][1] += points[i - 1][1]

    # Initialize the maximum intersection length and current number of segments
    max_length = 0
    current_segments = 0

    # Iterate over the points
    for position, count in points:
        current_segments += count

        # If we are currently within an intersection, update the maximum length
        if current_segments > 1:
            max_length = max(max_length, position - points[i - 1][0])

    return max_length


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read the input data
    n = int(input())
    segments = []
    for _ in range(n):
        segments.append(tuple(map(int, input().split())))

    # Calculate and print the maximum possible length
    print(solve(n, segments))
```

This code uses a sweep line algorithm to solve the problem. It first sorts the endpoints of all segments by their position, and then iterates over the points. For each point, it keeps track of the number of segments that contain it, and if it is currently within an intersection, it updates the maximum length of the
