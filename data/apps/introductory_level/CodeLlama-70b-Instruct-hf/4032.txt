Here is a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def solve(n):
    return n % 2


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    result = solve(n)
    print(result)
```

Explanation:

*   The `solve` function takes an integer `n` as input.
*   It calculates and returns the minimum possible value of $|sum(A) - sum(B)|$ as `n % 2`.
*   The `%` operator calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 2.
*   If `n` is odd, the remainder is 1, and the minimum possible value of $|sum(A) - sum(B)|$ is 1.
*   If `n` is even, the remainder is 0, and the minimum possible value of $|sum(A) - sum(B)|$ is 0.
*   The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block handles input/output.
*   It reads the input `n` from the user and passes it to the `solve` function.
*   The result is printed to the console.
