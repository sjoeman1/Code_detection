```py
n = int(input())
coords = list(map(int, input().split()))

even, odd = 0, 0
for coord in coords:
    if coord % 2 == 0:
        even += 1
    else:
        odd += 1

print(min(even, odd))
```





In this code, we first read the number of chips `n` and the coordinates of each chip. Then, we count the number of even-numbered coordinates and the number of odd-numbered coordinates. The minimum of these two counts is the minimum number of coins required to move all the chips to the same coordinate.
