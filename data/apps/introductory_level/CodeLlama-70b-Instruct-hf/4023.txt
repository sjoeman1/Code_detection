```python
# Read the input times
h1, m1 = map(int, input().split(':'))
h2, m2 = map(int, input().split(':'))

# Calculate the duration of the contest
total_minutes = (h2 - h1) * 60 + (m2 - m1)
midpoint_minutes = total_minutes // 2

# Calculate the midpoint time
h3 = (h1 * 60 + m1 + midpoint_minutes) // 60
m3 = (h1 * 60 + m1 + midpoint_minutes) % 60

# Print the result in the required format
print(f'{h3:02d}:{m3:02d}')
```

The above code reads the input times and calculates the duration of the contest in minutes. Then, it calculates the midpoint minutes by dividing the total minutes by 2.

To calculate the midpoint time, it adds the start time (h1 * 60 + m1) and midpoint minutes to find the total minutes. Then, it calculates the hours and minutes by dividing and modulo 60, respectively.

Finally, it prints the result in the required format with leading zeros for single-digit hours and minutes.
