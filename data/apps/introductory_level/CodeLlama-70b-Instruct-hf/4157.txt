Here is a Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```
def reorder(n, arr):
    # This function rearranges the elements of the array
    # in such a way that they match the game.

    # Find the smallest number in the array and store it in x.
    x = min(arr)

    # Create an empty list to store the rearranged sequence.
    rearranged = []

    # Iterate through the array and reorder the elements.
    for i in range(n):
        # Append x to the rearranged sequence.
        rearranged.append(x)

        # Check if x is divisible by 3.
        if x % 3 == 0:
            # If it is, then divide x by 3.
            x //= 3
        else:
            # If it is not, then multiply x by 2.
            x *= 2

    # Return the rearranged sequence.
    return rearranged


# Take input for the number of elements.
n = int(input())

# Take input for the sequence.
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Call the reorder function and print the rearranged sequence.
print(*reorder(n, arr))
```

This code defines a function `reorder` that takes the number of elements `n` and the array as input. It finds the smallest number in the array and stores it in `x`. It then creates an empty list to store the rearranged sequence. It iterates through the array and reorders the elements by appending `x` to the rearranged sequence and checking if `x` is divisible by 3. If it is, it divides `x` by 3, and if it is not, it multiplies `x` by 2. Finally, it returns the rearranged sequence. The main function takes input for the number of elements and the sequence, calls the `reorder` function, and prints the rearranged sequence.
