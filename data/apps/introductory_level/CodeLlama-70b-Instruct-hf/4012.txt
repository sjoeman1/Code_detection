Here's the Python3 code for solving the problem:

```python
# Input:
n = int(input())
a = input()
f = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Output:
print(max(f[int(x) - 1] for x in a))
```

The code starts by reading the input values, `n` and `a`, as integers and strings respectively. It then reads the values of `f(1)`, `f(2)`, ..., `f(9)` as integers and stores them in a list.

Next, it iterates through each digit in `a` and replaces it with the corresponding value of `f` using the `f[int(x) - 1]` expression.

Finally, it finds the maximum of these values using the `max()` function and prints it as the output.
