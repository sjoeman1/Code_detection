```py
def can_draw_polygon(sides):
    # Sort the sides in ascending order
    sides.sort()
    # Check if the longest side is shorter than the sum of the other sides
    if sides[-1] < sum(sides[:-1]):
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"


# Read the number of sides (N) from the input
N = int(input())

# Read the lengths of the sides (L_1, L_2, ..., L_N) from the input
sides = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Verify the input constraints
if not (3 <= N <= 10 and all(1 <= L <= 100 for L in sides)):
    print("Invalid input")
else:
    print(can_draw_polygon(sides))

```

This code defines a function `can_draw_polygon` that takes a list of polygon side lengths as input and checks if the longest side is shorter than the sum of the other sides. If it is, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

The main part of the code reads the input, verifies the input constraints, and then calls the `can_draw_polygon` function to determine whether the polygon can be drawn.
