 Here is the Python3 code for the problem:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
from collections import Counter

# Input the number of switches and bulbs
N, M = map(int, input().split())

# Input the switches each bulb is connected to
switches = []
for _ in range(M):
    k = int(input())
    switches.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

# Input the parity of each bulb
parity = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Count the number of switches each bulb is connected to
count = Counter()
for switch_set in switches:
    for switch in switch_set:
        count[switch] += 1

# Create a dictionary to store the number of combinations
# that light each bulb
combinations = {}

# Iterate through each switch
for switch in range(1, N + 1):
    # Initialize the number of combinations for each bulb
    combinations[switch] = [0] * M

    # Iterate through each bulb
    for bulb in range(M):
        # Check if the switch is connected to the bulb
        if switch in switches[bulb]:
            # If the switch is connected to the bulb,
            # increment the number of combinations that
            # light the bulb
            combinations[switch][bulb] += 1

    # Compute the number of combinations that light all bulbs
    total = 1
    for bulb in range(M):
        if parity[bulb] == 0:
            total *= 2 ** combinations[switch][bulb]
        else:
            total *= 2 ** (count[switch] - combinations[switch][bulb])

    # Print the result
    print(total)

```

This code solves the problem by first reading the input, then counting the number of switches each bulb is connected to. Then, it iterates through each switch and calculates the number of combinations that light each bulb. Finally, it computes the number of combinations that light all bulbs and prints the result.
