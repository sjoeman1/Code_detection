Here is the Python 3 code for solving the question:

```py
def shiritori(n, words):
    seen = set()
    for i in range(n):
        if words[i] in seen or (i >= 1 and words[i][0] != words[i - 1][-1]):
            return "No"
        seen.add(words[i])
    return "Yes"

n = int(input())
words = []
for _ in range(n):
    words.append(input())

print(shiritori(n, words))
```

In this code:

1.  The `shiritori` function takes `n` (the number of words) and `words` (the list of words) as input.
2.  It initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the words that have been announced before.
3.  It iterates through the words, checking if the current word is in the `seen` set (indicating a duplicate) or if the first character of the current word does not match the last character of the previous word (indicating a violation of the rule). If either condition is met, the function returns "No".
4.  If the loop completes without finding any violations, the function returns "Yes".
5.  The input is taken from the user, and the `shiritori` function is called with the input values.
6.  The result is printed to the console.
