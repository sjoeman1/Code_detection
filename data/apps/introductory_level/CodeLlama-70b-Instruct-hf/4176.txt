Here's the Python 3 code for the problem:

```python
# Takes in input from user
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Minimum number of pieces for A guests
min_A = (A * (A + 1)) // 2

# Minimum number of pieces for B guests
min_B = (B * (B + 1)) // 2

# Prints the minimum number of pieces
print(min_A + min_B)
```

This code takes in the input from the user, calculates the minimum number of pieces for both A and B guests, and then prints the total minimum number of pieces.
