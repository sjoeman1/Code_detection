Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```py
n = int(input())
t = input()

def solve(n, t):
    for d in range(n, 0, -1):
        t = t[::-1][:d] + t[d:][::-1]
    return t

print(solve(n, t))
```

The code first takes the input `n` and `t` from the user. Then, it defines the `solve` function, which takes `n` and `t` as parameters. Inside the function, it iterates over the divisors of `n` in decreasing order. For each divisor `d`, it reverses the substring `s[1...d]` and updates `t`. Finally, it returns `t`.

The code then prints the result of the `solve` function with the given input `n` and `t`.
