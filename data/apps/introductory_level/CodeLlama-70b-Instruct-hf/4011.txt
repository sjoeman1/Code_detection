Here is the Python3 code that solves the problem:

```python
# Inputs the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Iterates through each test case
for i in range(t):
    # Inputs the length of the array
    n = int(input())

    # Inputs the array elements
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Iterates through each possible subsequence of length at least 3
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 2, n):
            # Checks if the subsequence is a palindrome
            if a[i] == a[j] and a[i + 1] == a[j - 1]:
                print("YES")
                break
        else:
            continue
        break
    else:
        print("NO")
```

This code iterates through each test case and checks each possible subsequence of length at least 3 to determine if it is a palindrome. If it finds a palindrome, it prints "YES" and moves on to the next test case. If it does not find a palindrome, it prints "NO".
