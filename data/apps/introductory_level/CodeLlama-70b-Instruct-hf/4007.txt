Here is the Python3 code for the problem:
```py
def f(x):
    x += 1
    while x % 10 == 0:
        x //= 10
    return x


n = int(input())

# We will use a set to store the numbers that are reachable from n.
reachable_numbers = set()

# We will apply f to n until we get a number that is already in the set.
# This will ensure that we have found all reachable numbers from n.
while n not in reachable_numbers:
    reachable_numbers.add(n)
    n = f(n)

# Print the length of the set, which is the number of reachable numbers from n.
print(len(reachable_numbers))
```
This code works by applying the function `f` to `n` until it finds a number that is already in the set of reachable numbers. Each time it applies `f`, it adds the result to the set. Once it finds a number that is already in the set, it has found all reachable numbers from `n` and can print the length of the set.
