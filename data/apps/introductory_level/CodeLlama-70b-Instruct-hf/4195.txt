Here is the Python3 code to solve the question:

```python
# Read input
D, N = map(int, input().split())

# If D is 0, find the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times
if D == 0:
    result = N

# If D is 1, find the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 1 times
elif D == 1:
    result = 100 * N

# If D is 2, find the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 2 times
elif D == 2:
    result = 10000 * N

# Print the result
print(result)
```

The code reads the input `D` and `N` from the user, and then determines the result based on the value of `D`. If `D` is 0, the code finds the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times. If `D` is 1, it finds the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 1 times. If `D` is 2, it finds the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 2 times. Finally, it prints the result.
