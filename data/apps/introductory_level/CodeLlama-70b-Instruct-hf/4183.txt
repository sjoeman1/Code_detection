Here is the Python3 code:

```py
from fractions import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

n = int(input())
t = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]

result = reduce(lcm, t)
print(result)
```

The code above solves the problem by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of all the input numbers. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all the input numbers.

The `lcm` function calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b / gcd(a, b)`.

The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the `fractions` module.

The `reduce` function is used to apply the `lcm` function to all the input numbers, finding the LCM of all the numbers.

Finally, the result is printed.
