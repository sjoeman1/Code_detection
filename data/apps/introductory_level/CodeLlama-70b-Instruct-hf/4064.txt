This code defines a function `minimum_lights_off` that takes two arguments: `n`, the number of flats, and `arr`, the array of light states. The function iterates through the array, checking if each person is disturbed. If a person is disturbed, the count is incremented. Finally, the minimum number of lights to turn off is returned. The function is called with the input values and the result is printed.
