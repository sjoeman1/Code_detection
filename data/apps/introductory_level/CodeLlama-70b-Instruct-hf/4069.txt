Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:
```
n = int(input())
d = list(map(int, input().split()))
count = 0
for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
    arc = 0
    abc = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if d[j] >= i:
            arc += 1
        else:
            abc += 1
    if arc == abc:
        count += 1
print(count)
```

This code will read the input from the user and then calculate the count of the choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same. It will then print the calculated count as the output.
