```python
def superhero_fights_monster(H, n, d):
    if all(x < 0 for x in d):
        return -1
    k = 0
    while H > 0:
        for i in range(n):
            H += d[i]
            k += 1
            if H <= 0:
                return k
    return -1


H, n = map(int, input().split())
d = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(superhero_fights_monster(H, n, d))
```

This code defines a function `superhero_fights_monster` that takes three parameters: `H`, the initial hp of the monster, `n`, the number of minutes in a round, and `d`, the list of hp changes in each minute.

The function first checks if all elements in the list `d` are negative. If so, the monster cannot be killed and the function returns -1.

If there is at least one positive element in the list `d`, the function enters a while loop. The while loop continues as long as the monster's hp `H` is greater than 0. Inside the while loop, there is a for loop that iterates through the list `d`, adding each element to the monster's hp `H` and incrementing the minute counter `k`. If the monster's hp `H` becomes less than or equal to 0 during the for loop, the function returns the minute `k` at which the monster died.

If the while loop finishes without returning a value, it means that the monster's hp `H` never became less than or equal to 0, and the function returns -1 to indicate that the battle will continue infinitely.
