Here is the Python 3 code that solves the question:

```python
# Input
N, K, Q = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the scores for each player
scores = [K] * N

# Iterate through each answer
for i in range(Q):
    # Update the scores of all players
    for j in range(N):
        if j + 1 != A[i]:
            scores[j] -= 1

# Check if each player survived
for i in range(N):
    if scores[i] > 0:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```

This code:

1.  Takes input for N, K, Q, and A.
2.  Initializes the scores for each player.
3.  Iterates through each answer and updates the scores of all players.
4.  Checks if each player survived, printing "Yes" or "No" for each player.
