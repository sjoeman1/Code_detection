Here is the Python3 code for the given problem:

```
def count_monotonic_renumerations(a):
    n = len(a)
    cnt = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] == a[i - 1]:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
        else:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] * 2
    return (cnt[n - 1] % 998244353)


n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(count_monotonic_renumerations(a))
```

The code first takes the input for the number of elements in the array `a` and the elements in the array itself. Then, it calls the `count_monotonic_renumerations` function, which calculates the number of different monotonic renumerations of the given array by iterating through the array and updating the count for each element based on the previous element. Finally, it prints the result after taking the modulo 998244353.
