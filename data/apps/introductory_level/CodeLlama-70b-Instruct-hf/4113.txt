Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:
```
# Input the value of N from the user
N = int(input())

# Initialize the result to False
result = False

# Iterate over all possible combinations of cakes and doughnuts
for cakes in range(N // 4 + 1):
    for doughnuts in range(N // 7 + 1):
        if cakes * 4 + doughnuts * 7 == N:
            result = True
            break

# Print the result
if result:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

Explanation of the code:

1.  The code starts by reading the value of N from the user using the `input()` function.
2.  It initializes the result to `False`, assuming that there is no way to buy cakes and doughnuts for exactly N dollars.
3.  It iterates over all possible combinations of cakes and doughnuts, using nested for loops.
4.  For each combination, it checks if the total cost (cakes \* 4 + doughnuts \* 7) equals N. If it does, it sets the result to `True` and breaks out of the loops.
5.  Finally, it prints "Yes" if the result is `True`, indicating that there is a way to buy cakes and doughnuts for exactly N dollars, or "No" if the result is `False`, indicating that there is no way to do so.
