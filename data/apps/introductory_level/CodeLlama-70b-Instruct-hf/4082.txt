Here's a solution in Python 3:

```py
def solve(n):
    if n < 0 or n > 2000000000:
        raise ValueError("Input must be between 0 and 2000000000.")

    if n == 0:
        return 0

    result = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
        result += 1

    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(solve(11))
    print(solve(14))
    print(solve(61441))
    print(solve(571576))
    print(solve(2128506))
```

The `solve` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the number to 1.

If the input number is 0, it returns 0.

If the input number is even, it divides the number by 2.

If the input number is odd, it subtracts 1 from the number.

The function continues until the number becomes 1.

The number of iterations required is the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the number to 1.
