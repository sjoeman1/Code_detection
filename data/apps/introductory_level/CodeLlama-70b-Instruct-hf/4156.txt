 Here is the Python 3 code for the given problem:

```py
# The number of bus stops and bus capacity
n, w = map(int, input().split())

# The sequence of numbers recorded by the video system
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Dynamic programming array
dp = [0] * (w + 1)

# Base case
dp[0] = 1

# Loop through all bus stops
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(w, -1, -1):
        # Update the number of possible ways
        dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[max(j - a[i], 0)]) % 1000000007

# Print the number of possible ways
print(dp[0])
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1.  We read the input for the number of bus stops and bus capacity.
2.  We read the input for the sequence of numbers recorded by the video system.
3.  We initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` with size `w + 1`, where `w` is the bus capacity.
4.  We set the base case `dp[0] = 1`. This means that there is only one way to have 0 passengers in the bus before the first bus stop.
5.  We loop through all bus stops, starting from the first bus stop.
6.  For each bus stop, we loop through the number of passengers in the bus from `w` to 0 in reverse order.
7.  We update the number of possible ways `dp[j]` to have `j` passengers in the bus before the current bus stop by adding the number of possible ways `dp[max(j - a[i], 0)]` to have `j - a[i]` passengers in the bus before the previous bus stop.
8.  We take the maximum of `j - a[i]` and 0 to avoid negative values.
9.  We take the modulo of 1,000,000,007 to avoid overflow.
10. We print the number of possible ways `dp[0]` to have 0
