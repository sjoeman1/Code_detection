 Here is the Python 3 code to solve the question:

```python
# Read the input values of A and B
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize a flag to check if a valid price is found
found = False

# Initialize the price to 1
price = 1

# Iterate until the price is less than or equal to 100
while price <= 100:
    # Calculate the amount of consumption tax levied on the price with 8% tax rate
    tax8 = int(price * 0.08)

    # Calculate the amount of consumption tax levied on the price with 10% tax rate
    tax10 = int(price * 0.1)

    # Check if both taxes match the given values A and B
    if tax8 == A and tax10 == B:
        # Set the flag to True
        found = True

        # Print the lowest price that satisfies the condition
        print(price)

        # Break out of the loop
        break

    # Increment the price
    price += 1

# If no price satisfies the condition, print -1
if not found:
    print(-1)
```

In this code, we read the input values of A and B. We initialize a flag to check if a valid price is found. We then iterate through prices from 1 to 100, calculating the amount of consumption tax levied on each price with 8% and 10% tax rates. If both taxes match the given values A and B, we set the flag to True, print the lowest price that satisfies the condition, and break out of the loop. If no price satisfies the condition, we print -1.
