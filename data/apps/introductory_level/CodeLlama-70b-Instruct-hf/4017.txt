The problem statement is to construct a string $s$ of minimum possible length such that there are exactly $k$ positions $i$ such that $s[i \dots i + n - 1] = t$. In other words, we need to construct a string $s$ such that there are exactly $k$ substrings of $s$ equal to $t$.

Here's a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def construct_string(n, k, t):
    # Base case: If k is 1, then the string is t itself
    if k == 1:
        return t
    # Calculate the length of t
    len_t = len(t)
    # Initialize the result string as an empty string
    result = ""
    # Construct the result string
    for i in range(k):
        # Add t to the result string
        result += t
        # Add (n - len_t) number of characters to the result string
        result += "a" * (n - len_t)
    # Return the result string
    return result

# Read the input
n, k = map(int, input().split())
t = input()
# Construct the string
result = construct_string(n, k, t)
# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this code, we first read the input values for `n` and `k`. Then, we read the string `t`.

The `construct_string` function is used to construct the string `s` of minimum possible length such that there are exactly `k` substrings of `s` equal to `t`. It takes `n`, `k`, and `t` as input parameters.

Inside the `construct_string` function, we first check if `k` is equal to 1. If it is, then the string `s` is simply `t` itself.

If `k` is not equal to 1, we calculate the length of `t` and initialize the `result` string as an empty string. We then iterate over the range from 0 to `k - 1`. For each iteration, we add `t` to the `result` string and then add `(n - len_t)` number of characters to the
