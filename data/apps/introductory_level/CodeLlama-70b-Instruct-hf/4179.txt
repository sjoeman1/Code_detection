Here is the Python 3 code to solve the question:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Read the input from the standard input
N, M, C = map(int, input().split())
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the count of codes that correctly solve this problem
count = 0

# Iterate over the N codes
for _ in range(N):
    # Read the characteristics of the current code
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Calculate the sum of A_i * B_i for all i
    sum_A_B = 0
    for i in range(M):
        sum_A_B += A[i] * B[i]

    # Check if the current code correctly solves this problem
    if sum_A_B + C > 0:
        count += 1

# Print the number of codes that correctly solve this problem
print(count)
```

The provided code reads the input from the standard input and calculates the sum of `A_i * B_i` for all `i` and checks if the sum plus `C` is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the count of codes that correctly solve the problem. Finally, it prints the count of codes that correctly solve this problem.
