The code for the problem is as follows:

```python
# Function to evaluate the arithmetic expression and reproduce the bug
def evaluate_expression(expression):
    # Split the expression into operands and operators
    operands = expression.split('+')
    result = 0
    for operand in operands:
        if '-' in operand:
            # Split the operand into sub-operands and subtract each from result
            sub_operands = operand.split('-')
            for sub_operand in sub_operands:
                result -= int(sub_operand)
        else:
            # Add the operand to the result
            result += int(operand)
    return result

# Read the input from the user
expression = input()

# Evaluate the expression and reproduce the bug
result = evaluate_expression(expression)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

The code first splits the expression into operands and operators. It then iterates over the operands, subtracts each operand from the result if it contains a minus sign, and adds the operand to the result if it does not contain a minus sign.

The bug is reproduced because the code subtracts each operand from the result even if the operator is a plus sign, which is incorrect. This bug is intentional to simulate the behavior of the reference solution.
