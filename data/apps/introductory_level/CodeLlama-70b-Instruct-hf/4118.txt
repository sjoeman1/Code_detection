Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Get input from the user
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Check if A and B are between 1 and 9
if 1 <= A <= 9 and 1 <= B <= 9:
    # Calculate A * B and print the result
    print(A * B)
else:
    # Print -1 if A or B are not between 1 and 9
    print(-1)
```

This code first takes the input `A` and `B` from the user and then checks if they are between 1 and 9. If they are, it calculates `A * B` and prints the result. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
