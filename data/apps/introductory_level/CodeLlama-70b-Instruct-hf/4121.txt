Here is the Python 3 code that solves the question:

```py
def solve(n, a):
    # Find the minimum height of the wall
    min_height = min(a)
    # Initialize the number of bricks required
    num_bricks = 0

    # Iterate through the wall
    for height in a:
        # Calculate the difference between the current height and the minimum height
        diff = height - min_height
        # Add the difference to the number of bricks required
        num_bricks += diff

    # If the number of bricks required is divisible by 2, the wall can be completed
    if num_bricks % 2 == 0:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"


# Input the number of parts of the wall
n = int(input())
# Input the heights of the parts of the wall
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Call the solve function and print the result
print(solve(n, a))
```

This code defines a function `solve` that takes the number of parts of the wall `n` and the heights of the parts `a` as input. It finds the minimum height of the wall, calculates the number of bricks required to complete the wall, and determines whether the wall can be completed. The code then takes the input, calls the `solve` function, and prints the result.
