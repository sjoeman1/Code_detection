Here is the Python 3 code to solve the problem:

```
def gcd(a, b, c):
    def gcd(x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x
    return gcd(gcd(a, b), c)

def solve(K):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, K + 1):
        for b in range(1, K + 1):
            for c in range(1, K + 1):
                ans += gcd(a, b, c)
    return ans

def main():
    K = int(input())
    print(solve(K))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The code first defines a function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor of three numbers. It then defines a function `solve` to calculate the sum of gcd(a,b,c) for all possible combinations of a, b, and c between 1 and K (inclusive). Finally, it reads the input K from the user and prints the result of `solve(K)`.
