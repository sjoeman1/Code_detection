Here is the Python 3 code for solving the question:

```
def base_minus_two(N):
    if N == 0:
        return "0"
    if N < 0:
        return "-" + base_minus_two(-N)
    result = ""
    while N > 0:
        result = str(N % 2) + result
        N //= -2
    return result

def main():
    N = int(input())
    print(base_minus_two(N))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, the function `base_minus_two` takes an integer `N` as input and returns its base -2 representation as a string. It first checks if `N` is 0, in which case it returns "0". If `N` is negative, it appends a "-" sign to the base -2 representation of the absolute value of `N`.

If `N` is a positive integer, the function constructs the base -2 representation by repeatedly dividing `N` by -2 and appending the remainder to the result string. Finally, it returns the constructed string as the base -2 representation of `N`.

In the `main` function, it reads the input `N` from standard input and prints the base -2 representation of `N` using the `base_minus_two` function.
