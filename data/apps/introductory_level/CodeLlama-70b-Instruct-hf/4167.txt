```python
def count_triplets(N, K):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, N + 1):
        for b in range(1, N + 1):
            for c in range(1, N + 1):
                if (a + b) % K == 0 and (b + c) % K == 0 and (c + a) % K == 0:
                    count += 1
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_triplets(N, K))
```

The `count_triplets` function takes the two input integers `N` and `K` as parameters and counts the number of triples that satisfy the given condition. The main function takes the input from the user and prints the number of triples.
