Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```python
# Input the values of n, d and k
n, d, k = map(int, input().split())

# Check if it is possible to construct a tree with the given conditions
if n == 1:
    print("YES")
else:
    if d < k - 1:
        print("NO")
    else:
        # Construct a tree with the given conditions
        print("YES")
        for i in range(2, n):
            print(i, i - 1)
        for i in range(2, k):
            print(1, i)
        for i in range(k + 1, n):
            print(k, i)
```

This code will first read the input values for `n`, `d`, and `k` from the user. Then, it will check if it is possible to construct a tree with the given conditions. If `n` is 1, then the diameter and degree are irrelevant, and the tree exists. If `d` is less than `k - 1`, then the diameter is smaller than the minimum possible diameter for a tree with degree at most `k`, so it is impossible. Otherwise, it constructs the tree by adding edges from each node to its predecessor, then adds edges from node 1 to the first `k - 1` nodes, and finally adds edges from node `k` to the remaining nodes.
