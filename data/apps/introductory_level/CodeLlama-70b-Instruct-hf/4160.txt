 Here is the Python3 code for solving the problem:

```python
# Takahashi's initial deposit
takahashi = 100

# Input the desired balance
x = int(input())

# Initialize the number of years to 0
years = 0

# Loop until Takahashi's balance reaches or exceeds x
while takahashi < x:
    # Increase the number of years
    years += 1
    # Calculate the interest earned in the current year
    interest = takahashi // 100
    # Add the interest to Takahashi's balance
    takahashi += interest

# Print the number of years it takes for Takahashi's balance to reach x or above
print(years)
```

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1.  **Initialization**: We set Takahashi's initial deposit to 100 yen and initialize the number of years to 0.
2.  **Input**: We take input from the user for the desired balance, `x`.
3.  **Loop**: We use a while loop to keep updating Takahashi's balance until it reaches or exceeds `x`.
4.  **Calculating Interest**: For each year, we calculate the interest earned by dividing Takahashi's balance by 100 and discarding any fractional yen.
5.  **Updating Balance**: We add the interest to Takahashi's balance for each year.
6.  **Incrementing Years**: If Takahashi's balance is still less than `x`, we increment the number of years by 1.
7.  **Printing Result**: After the loop terminates, we print the number of years it took for Takahashi's balance to reach `x` or above.

This code will solve the problem and produce the desired output.
