Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```
n = int(input())

# Read the input
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Create a list to store the count of students with each skill level
count = [0] * 101

# Calculate the count of students with each skill level
for skill in a:
    count[skill] += 1

# Initialize the number of pairs that can form a team
pairs = 0

# Initialize the number of problems that need to be solved
problems = 0

# Iterate through all the skill levels
for skill in range(1, 101):
    # If there are students with the current skill level, and the number of students with this skill level is even
    if count[skill] > 0 and count[skill] % 2 == 0:
        # Increment the number of pairs that can form a team
        pairs += count[skill] // 2
    # If there are students with the current skill level, and the number of students with this skill level is odd
    elif count[skill] > 0:
        # Increment the number of problems that need to be solved by the number of students with this skill level - 1
        problems += count[skill] - 1

# Calculate the total number of problems that need to be solved
total_problems = problems * (n - pairs * 2)

# Print the total number of problems that need to be solved
print(total_problems)
```

The code reads the number of students, $n$, and the skill levels of each student, $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. It then counts the number of students with each skill level and calculates the number of pairs of students who can form a team. If the number of students with a particular skill level is odd, it adds the number of students minus one to the number of problems that need to be solved. Finally, it calculates the total number of problems that need to be solved and prints it as the output.
