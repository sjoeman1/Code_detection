Here's a possible Python3 code to solve the question:

```python
# Read the input values from standard input
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the dp list to store the maximum number of monsters that can be defeated
dp = [0] * (N+1)

# Update the dp list using the given logic
for i in range(N):
    if i == 0:
        dp[i+1] = max(A[i], B[i])
    else:
        dp[i+1] = max(dp[i] + B[i], A[i+1])

# Print the maximum number of monsters that can be defeated
print(dp[N])
```

In this code:

*   We read the input values `N`, `A`, and `B` from standard input.
*   We initialize the `dp` list to store the maximum number of monsters that can be defeated.
*   We update the `dp` list using the given logic:

    *   If `i` is 0, we set `dp[i+1]` to the maximum of `A[i]` and `B[i]`.
    *   Otherwise, we set `dp[i+1]` to the maximum of `dp[i] + B[i]` and `A[i+1]`.
*   Finally, we print the maximum number of monsters that can be defeated, which is `dp[N]`.
