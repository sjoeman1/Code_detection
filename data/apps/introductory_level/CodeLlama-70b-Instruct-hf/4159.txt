Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:
```
# Input the values of A, B, and K
A, B, K = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the number of cookies
takahashi_cookies = A
aoki_cookies = B

# Perform the actions K times
for _ in range(K):
    # If Takahashi has one or more cookies, eat one of his cookies
    if takahashi_cookies > 0:
        takahashi_cookies -= 1
    # Otherwise, if Aoki has one or more cookies, eat one of Aoki's cookies
    elif aoki_cookies > 0:
        aoki_cookies -= 1
    # If they both have no cookies, do nothing

# Print the numbers of Takahashi's and Aoki's cookies after K actions
print(takahashi_cookies, aoki_cookies)
```

This code takes input for A, B, and K from the user. It then initializes the number of cookies for Takahashi and Aoki. The code then performs the actions K times, following the conditions provided. Finally, it prints the number of cookies Takahashi and Aoki have after K actions.
