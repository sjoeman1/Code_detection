Here is the Python3 code that provides the solution:

```python
def count_tuples(n):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n):
        for b in range(1, n):
            for c in range(1, n):
                if a * b + c == n:
                    count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(count_tuples(n))
```

In this code, we define a function `count_tuples` that takes `n` as a parameter. Inside the function, we use three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` from 1 to `n`. For each combination, we check if `a * b + c == n`. If this condition is satisfied, we increment the `count` variable. Finally, we return the `count` variable as the number of tuples that satisfy the given condition.

The main part of the code takes input for `n` and calls the `count_tuples` function to calculate and print the number of tuples that satisfy the given condition.
