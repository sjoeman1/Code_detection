Here is the Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Function to calculate the number of pairs with median m
def countPairs(a, n, m):
    # Count the occurrence of m in the array
    count = a.count(m)
    # Calculate the number of pairs with median m
    return count * (count - 1) // 2

# Driver code
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = countPairs(a, n, m)
print(ans)
```

This code works by first reading the input, which consists of two integers, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the length of the sequence, and `m` represents the required value of the median.

The second line of input is read and split into a list of integers, `a`.

The `countPairs` function is defined, which takes the input list `a`, the length `n`, and the required median `m`. It counts the number of occurrences of `m` in the list using the `count` method.

Then, it calculates the number of pairs with median `m` by multiplying the count of `m` by the count of `m` minus one, divided by two. This is because each occurrence of `m` can be paired with all other occurrences of `m` to form a pair with median `m`.

Finally, the `countPairs` function is called with the input values, and the result is printed.
