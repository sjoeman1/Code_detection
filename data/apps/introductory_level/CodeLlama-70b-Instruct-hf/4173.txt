Here's the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
def min_money_to_buy(n, a, b):
    min_burles = 0
    # Check if n is odd or even
    if n % 2 == 0:
        min_burles = n // 2 * b
    else:
        min_burles = (n // 2 * b) + a

    return min_burles

q = int(input())

for _ in range(q):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(min_money_to_buy(n, a, b))
```

This code defines a function `min_money_to_buy` that calculates the minimum amount of burles needed to buy `n` liters of water using `a` burles for a 1-liter bottle and `b` burles for a 2-liter bottle. The function first checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is even, it calculates the minimum amount of burles as `n // 2 * b`. If `n` is odd, it calculates the minimum amount of burles as `(n // 2 * b) + a`.

The code then takes the input `q`, the number of queries. It then loops `q` times, taking input `n`, `a`, and `b` for each query. It calls the `min_money_to_buy` function with these values and prints the result.
