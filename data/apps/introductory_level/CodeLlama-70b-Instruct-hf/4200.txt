Here is a Python3 code that solves the problem:

```
# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
votes = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the minimum votes needed for an item to be popular
total_votes = sum(votes)
min_votes = total_votes // (4 * m)

# Check if there are M items with at least min_votes votes
popular_items = [vote >= min_votes for vote in votes]
if sum(popular_items) >= m:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

Here's how the code works:

1.  Read input:
    *   Read the values of N and M from the first line of input and store them in the variables `n` and `m`.
    *   Read the votes for each item from the second line of input and store them in the list `votes`.
2.  Calculate the minimum votes needed for an item to be popular:
    *   Calculate the total number of votes by summing all the values in the `votes` list.
    *   Calculate the minimum votes needed for an item to be popular by dividing the total votes by 4M (using integer division).
3.  Check if there are M items with at least min_votes votes:
    *   Create a list `popular_items` where each item is True if its corresponding vote in the `votes` list is greater than or equal to `min_votes`.
    *   If the sum of True values in `popular_items` is greater than or equal to M, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".
