Here is the Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```python
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys


#
# Complete the 'solve' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER r
#  2. 2D_INTEGER_ARRAY projects
#

def solve(r, projects):
    # Sort the projects by the required rating to complete them
    projects.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Initialize the subset and the current rating
    subset = []
    current_rating = r

    # Iterate through the projects
    for project in projects:
        required_rating, rating_change = project

        # Check if we have enough rating to complete the project
        if current_rating >= required_rating:
            subset.append(project)
            current_rating += rating_change

    # Return the size of the subset
    return len(subset)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    first_multiple_input = input().rstrip().split()

    n = int(first_multiple_input[0])

    r = int(first_multiple_input[1])

    projects = []

    for _ in range(n):
        projects.append(list(map(int, input().rstrip().split())))

    result = solve(r, projects)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()

```

This code uses the following approach:

1.  It sorts the projects by the required rating to complete them in ascending order.
2.  It initializes an empty subset and sets the current rating to the initial rating provided.
3.  It iterates through the projects in the sorted order.
4.  For each project, it checks if the current rating is greater than or equal to the required rating to complete the project.
5.  If the current rating is sufficient, it adds the
