This problem can be solved using Python3 with the following code:

```
# Read the input
a, b = input().split()

# Convert the input to integers
a = int(a)
b = int(b)

# Calculate the sum of a and b
sum = a + b

# Print the sum
print(sum)
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

*   The code starts with reading the input, which is stored in the variable `a` and `b`. The `input()` function is used to read the input from the user. The `split()` function is used to separate the input into two integers.
*   Next, the code converts the input to integers using the `int()` function. This is necessary because the input is read as a string, and we need to convert it to an integer to perform mathematical operations.
*   The code then calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and stores the result in the variable `sum`.
*   Finally, the code prints the sum using the `print()` function.

The code is designed to be a simple solution to the problem, using basic Python concepts.
