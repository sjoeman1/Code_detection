Here is the Python 3 code to solve the problem:

```
# Read the input from stdin
n, x = map(int, input().split())
L = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the D_i sequence
D = [0]

# Calculate D_i
for i in range(n + 1):
    D.append(D[i] + L[i])

# Count the number of bounces with coordinates less than or equal to X
count = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    if D[i] <= x:
        count += 1

# Print the result
print(count)
```

The code reads the input from standard input in the given format. It then initializes the D_i sequence with the starting value of 0. Then, it calculates D_i using the provided formula. Finally, it counts the number of bounces with coordinates less than or equal to X and prints the result.
