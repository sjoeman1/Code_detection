```python
n = int(input())
divisors = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

# Get the list of unique divisors
unique_divisors = list(set(divisors))

# Sort the list in ascending order
unique_divisors.sort()

# Initialize x and y
x, y = 1, 1

# Iterate through the unique divisors
for d in unique_divisors:
    # Count the number of occurrences of d in the list of divisors
    count = divisors.count(d)

    # If d is a divisor of both x and y, count will be 2
    if count == 2:
        x *= d
        y *= d
    # If d is a divisor of x, count will be 1
    elif count == 1:
        x *= d
    # If d is a divisor of y, count will be 0
    else:
        y *= d

print(x, y)
```

This Python code takes the input of the number of divisors and the list of divisors, finds the unique divisors, sorts them in ascending order, initializes x and y, iterates through the unique divisors, counts the number of occurrences of each divisor, and assigns the appropriate divisor to x or y based on the count. Finally, it prints the values of x and y.
