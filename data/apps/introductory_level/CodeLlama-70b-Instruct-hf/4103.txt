ðŸ¤– Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
def robot_walk(n, b, a, s):
    max_steps = 0
    curr_steps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 1:
            if b > 0:
                curr_steps += 1
                b -= 1
                a += 1
            else:
                curr_steps = 0
        else:
            if a > 0:
                curr_steps += 1
                a -= 1
            else:
                curr_steps = 0
        max_steps = max(max_steps, curr_steps)
    return max_steps

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, b, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = robot_walk(n, b, a, s)
    print(result)
```

This code defines a function `robot_walk` that takes the inputs `n`, `b`, `a`, and `s` and returns the maximum number of segments the robot can pass. It iterates through the array `s` and checks if the current segment is exposed to sunlight. If it is, it decreases the battery's charge `b` and increases the accumulator's charge `a`. If the segment is not exposed to sunlight, it decreases the accumulator's charge `a`. The function keeps track of the maximum number of segments the robot can pass and returns it.
