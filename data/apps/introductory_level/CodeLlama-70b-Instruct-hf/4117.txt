 Here is the Python 3 code to solve the question:
```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
n = int(input())
sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        for k in range(j+1, n):
            if sticks[i] != sticks[j] and sticks[i] != sticks[k] and sticks[j] != sticks[k]:
                if sticks[i] + sticks[j] > sticks[k] and sticks[i] + sticks[k] > sticks[j] and sticks[j] + sticks[k] > sticks[i]:
                    count += 1

print(count)
```
This code reads the number of sticks N from the first line of input. It then reads the lengths of the sticks L_1, L_2, ..., L_N from the second line of input and stores them in a list.

The code then iterates through all possible combinations of three sticks (i, j, k) where 1 <= i < j < k <= N. For each combination, it checks if the lengths of the sticks are all different and if they can form a triangle. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the count.

Finally, it prints the count of ways to choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle.
