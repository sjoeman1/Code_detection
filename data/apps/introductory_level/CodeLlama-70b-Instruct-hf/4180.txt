Here is the Python3 code for solving the problem:

```
# Input the cost of the product in yen
N = int(input())

# Initialize the change to zero
change = 0

# Calculate the number of 1000-yen bills required
bills = N // 1000

# Calculate the amount of change (remainder)
change = N - (bills * 1000)

# Print the amount of change as an integer
print(change)
```

This code will take the input `N`, calculate the number of 1000-yen bills required, and then calculate the amount of change. The change is then printed as an integer.
