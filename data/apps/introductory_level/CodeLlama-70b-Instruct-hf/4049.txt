In the first example, the substring "aba" can be removed from "bbaba" to obtain "bb", and "bb" is a subsequence of "bb". The length of the removed substring is 3.

In the second example, the substring "aa" can be removed from "baaba" to obtain "bab", and "ab" is a subsequence of "bab". The length of the removed substring is 2.

In the third example, no substring needs to be removed from "abcde" as "abcde" is already a subsequence of itself. The length of the removed substring is 0.

In the fourth example, the substring "sdf" can be removed from "asdfasdf" to obtain "aafa", and "fasd" is a subsequence of "aafa". The length of the removed substring is 3.

Here is the Python 3 code to solve the problem:

```
# Function to find the length of the longest common subsequence
def lcs(s1, s2):
    n = len(s1)
    m = len(s2)
    lcs = [[0 for _ in range(m + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                lcs[i][j] = lcs[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i - 1][j], lcs[i][j - 1])

    return lcs[n][m]


# Function to find the length of the longest substring that can be removed
def max_removable_length(s, t):
    n = len(s)
    m = len(t)
    lcs_len = lcs(s, t)

    # If the LCS is equal to the length of the smaller string,
    # then no substring needs to be removed
    if lcs_len == min(n, m):
        return 0

    #
