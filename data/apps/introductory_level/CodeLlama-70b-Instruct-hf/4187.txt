```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_rest = 0
current_rest = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == 1:
        current_rest += 1
    else:
        max_rest = max(max_rest, current_rest)
        current_rest = 0
max_rest = max(max_rest, current_rest)
print(max_rest)
```

In this code, we first read the input `n` and the schedule `a`. Then we iterate over the schedule and count the number of consecutive rest hours. If we encounter a working hour, we update the `max_rest` to the maximum of the current longest rest and the current consecutive rest. Finally, we print the `max_rest`.
