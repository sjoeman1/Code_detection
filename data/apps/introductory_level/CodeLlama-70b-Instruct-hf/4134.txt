Here's a Python 3 solution:

```python
def calculate_paths(n, m, k, grid):
    # Base case for empty grid
    if n == 0 or m == 0:
        return 0

    # Create a 2D array to store the number of paths to each cell
    dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

    # Initialize the top row and leftmost column with 1
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(m):
        dp[0][j] = 1

    # Dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            # Calculate the xor sum of the current cell with the paths to the top and left cells
            top_xor_sum = dp[i - 1][j] ^ grid[i - 1][j]
            left_xor_sum = dp[i][j - 1] ^ grid[i][j - 1]

            # If the xor sum is equal to k, add 1 to the number of paths to the current cell
            if top_xor_sum == k:
                dp[i][j] += 1
            if left_xor_sum == k:
                dp[i][j] += 1

    # Return the number of paths to the bottom-right cell
    return dp[n - 1][m - 1]

# Read the input
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
grid = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate_paths(n, m, k, grid)
print(result)
```

This Python 3 solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It creates a 2D array to store the number of paths to each cell, initializing the top row and leftmost column with 1. Then, it iterates through the grid, calculating the xor sum of the current cell with the paths to the top and left cells. If the xor sum is
