The code for the given problem is provided below:

```
def min_operations(n, x, y, digits):
    # Calculate the remainder of the given number modulo 10^x.
    rem = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, max(n - x, 0) - 1, -1):
        rem = (rem * 10 + digits[i]) % 10**x

    # Calculate the remainder of 10^y modulo 10^x.
    rem10y = pow(10, y, 10**x)

    # Calculate the minimum number of operations to make the remainders equal.
    diff = (rem10y - rem) % 10**x
    return diff


# Read the input data.
n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
digits = list(map(int, input()))

# Calculate and print the result.
print(min_operations(n, x, y, digits))
```

In this code, the function `min_operations` calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make the given number have a remainder of $10^y$ modulo $10^x$. It does this by first calculating the remainder of the given number modulo $10^x$, then calculating the remainder of $10^y$ modulo $10^x$, and finally calculating the minimum number of operations needed to make these remainders equal. The remainder of $10^y$ modulo $10^x$ is calculated using the modular exponentiation algorithm, which is implemented in Python using the `pow` function.
