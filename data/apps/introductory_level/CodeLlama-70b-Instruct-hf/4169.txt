Here is the Python 3 code for solving the problem:

```python
# Input the number of stores and number of energy drinks needed
n, m = map(int, input().split())
# Create a list to store the prices and quantities of energy drinks at each store
prices, quantities = [], []
# Iterate through the list of stores and input the price and quantity of energy drinks available
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    prices.append(a)
    quantities.append(b)
# Sort the prices and quantities lists in ascending order
prices, quantities = zip(*sorted(zip(prices, quantities)))
# Initialize the minimum amount of money needed
min_money = 0
# Iterate through the list of stores
for price, quantity in zip(prices, quantities):
    # Calculate the maximum number of energy drinks that can be bought at the current store
    drinks = min(m, quantity)
    # Add the cost of the energy drinks to the minimum amount of money needed
    min_money += drinks * price
    # Subtract the number of energy drinks bought from the total number needed
    m -= drinks
    # If the total number needed becomes 0, break the loop
    if m == 0:
        break
# Print the minimum amount of money needed
print(min_money)
```

This code will take input from the user, calculate the minimum amount of money needed to buy the specified number of energy drinks, and output the result.
