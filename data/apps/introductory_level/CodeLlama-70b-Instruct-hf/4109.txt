Here is the Python3 code for the problem:

```python
# Inputs
M = int(input("Enter the number of algorithms: "))
N = int(input("Enter the number of books: "))
A = []
C = []
for i in range(N):
    C.append(int(input("Enter the cost of book %d: " % (i+1))))
    A.append([0] * M)
    for j in range(M):
        A[i][j] = int(input("Enter the increase in understanding level of algorithm %d due to book %d: " % (j+1, i+1)))
X = int(input("Enter the minimum understanding level required: "))

# Dynamic programming
dp = [[0] * (M+1) for _ in range(N+1)]
for i in range(N+1):
    for j in range(M+1):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i][j] = j * X
        elif j == 0:
            dp[i][j] = 0
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + C[i-1])

# Check if achievable
if dp[N][M] >= 0:
    print("Objective achievable")
    print("Minimum amount of money needed: %d" % dp[N][M])
else:
    print("Objective not achievable")
```

This code asks for user input to determine the number of algorithms, number of books, cost of each book, and the increase in understanding level of each algorithm due to each book. It also asks for the minimum understanding level required.

The code uses dynamic programming to find the minimum amount of money needed to achieve the objective of making all the algorithms' understanding levels at least X or higher. It prints the result based on whether the objective is achievable or not.
