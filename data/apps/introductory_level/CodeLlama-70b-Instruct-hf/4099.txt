Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:

```python
def nearest_interesting_number(a):
    def is_interesting(n):
        # Check if the sum of the digits of n is divisible by 4
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n)) % 4 == 0

    # If a is already an interesting number, return it
    if is_interesting(a):
        return a

    # Increment a until it becomes an interesting number
    while not is_interesting(a):
        a += 1

    return a

# Read the input
a = int(input())

# Find the nearest larger or equal interesting number
n = nearest_interesting_number(a)

# Print the result
print(n)
```

This code defines a function `nearest_interesting_number` that takes an integer `a` as input and returns the nearest larger or equal interesting number. It first defines a helper function `is_interesting` that checks if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 4. Then, it checks if `a` is already an interesting number. If not, it increments `a` until it becomes an interesting number, and finally returns the result.
