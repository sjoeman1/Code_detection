Here is the Python 3 code for solving the question:

```python
def check_doublets(N, dice_rolls):
    # Initialize a counter to count the number of consecutive doublets
    doublet_count = 0

    # Iterate through the dice rolls
    for i in range(N):
        # Check if the current roll is a doublet
        if dice_rolls[i][0] == dice_rolls[i][1]:
            # Increment the doublet count
            doublet_count += 1
        else:
            # Reset the doublet count
            doublet_count = 0

        # If the doublet count is greater than or equal to 3,
        # we have found at least three consecutive doublets
        if doublet_count >= 3:
            return True

    # If we reach this point, no triple doublets were found
    return False

# Read the number of dice rolls
N = int(input())

# Initialize an empty list to store the dice rolls
dice_rolls = []

# Read the dice rolls
for _ in range(N):
    D1, D2 = map(int, input().split())
    dice_rolls.append([D1, D2])

# Check if triple doublets occurred
if check_doublets(N, dice_rolls):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This code first reads the input values for N and the dice rolls. Then, it iterates through the dice rolls and checks if the current roll is a doublet. If it is, it increments a counter for consecutive doublets. If the current roll is not a doublet, it resets the counter. If the counter reaches 3 or more, it means that triple doublets occurred, and the code prints "Yes". If the loop ends without finding triple doublets, it prints "No".
