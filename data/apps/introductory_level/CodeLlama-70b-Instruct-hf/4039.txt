Here is a Python 3 code that solves the problem:

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# We need to make sure that a and b are positive integers
if a < 0 or b < 0:
    raise ValueError("Both a and b must be positive integers.")

# The sum of a and b must be even
if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
    raise ValueError("The sum of a and b must be even.")

# Find the largest square that fits within the rectangle
max_square_size = min(a, b)

# Calculate the perimeter of the largest square
perimeter = 4 * max_square_size

# Subtract the remaining tiles from a and b
a -= max_square_size
b -= max_square_size

# Calculate the perimeter of the remaining rectangle
perimeter += 2 * (a + b)

# Print the final perimeter
print(perimeter)
```

This code assumes that the input is in the format `a b`, where `a` is the number of tiles red marker should color and `b` is the number of tiles blue marker should color.

The code first checks if both `a` and `b` are positive integers. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError` exception.

Next, it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If it is not, it means that it is not possible to form a rectangle with an odd number of tiles. In this case, it raises a `ValueError` exception.

Then, it finds the largest square that fits within the rectangle. This is done by finding the minimum of `a` and `b`.

It calculates the perimeter of the largest square by multiplying the square's side length by 4.

After that, it subtracts the square's side length from both `a` and `b`.

Finally, it calculates the perimeter of the remaining rectangle by adding twice the sum of the remaining `a` and `b` to the perimeter.

The code prints the final perimeter as the output.
