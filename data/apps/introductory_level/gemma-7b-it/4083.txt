```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()
operations = 0
equal = 0
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] >= k - equal:
        operations += 1
        a[i] = 0
        equal += 1

print(operations)
```

**Explanation:**
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Iterate over the array and count the number of operations required to make each element equal to $k - equal. 
3. If the element is greater than or equal to $k - equal, increment operations and set the element to 0.
4. Increment equal by 1 for each element that is made equal to $k - equal.
5. Print operations.
