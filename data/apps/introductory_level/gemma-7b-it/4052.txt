```python
n = int(input())
s = input().lower()
t = input().lower()

if s == t:
    print(0)
    print()

moves = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] != t[i]:
        moves += 1
        c = i
        s[i] = t[i]
        s[i + 1] = t[i]

if moves <= 1000:
    print(moves)
    print(*[c + 1] * moves)
else:
    print(-1)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the length of the strings $s$ and $t, the string $s$, and the string $t$.
* It checks if $s$ is equal to $t$. If it is, it prints $0 and exits.
* It iterates over the string $s$ and checks if the character at the current position is not equal to the character at the same position in $t. If it is not, it increments the number of moves and swaps the characters at the current position and the position one to the right.
* If the number of moves is less than or equal to $1000, it prints the number of moves, followed by the positions of the swaps.
* If the number of moves is greater than $1000, it prints -1.
