```python
a = int(input())
n = a + 1
while not (sum(str(n).split()) % 4 == 0 and n >= a):
    n += 1
print(n)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input integer $a$.
* It starts from $a + 1 and iteratively increases $n until the sum of digits of $n is divisible by 4 and $n is greater than or equal to $a.
* The code uses the `sum(str(n).split())` function to calculate the sum of digits of $n.
* The code uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the sum of digits is divisible by 4.
* The code prints the value of $n.

**Time Complexity:**

* The code iterates over the number $n$ only once, so the time complexity is O(1).

**Space Complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of $a$.
