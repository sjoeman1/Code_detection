```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()

ans = 1
curr = a[0]
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] <= 2 * curr:
        ans += 1
    curr = a[i]

print(ans)
```

**Explanation:**

* We maintain a variable `curr` to store the current difficulty.
* We iterate over the problems and add them to the contest if their difficulty is less than or equal to twice the current difficulty.
* We update the current difficulty if necessary.
* The number of problems in the contest is stored in the variable `ans`.
* Finally, the answer is printed.
