```python
n = int(input())

# Calculate the minimum number of moves needed to reach a square that contains N
moves = int((n-1) // 2) + 1

# Print the minimum number of moves
print(moves)
```

**Explanation:**

- The minimum number of moves needed to reach a square that contains N is equal to the number of squares that are below and to the left of the square containing N, plus 1.
- The number of squares that are below and to the left of the square containing N is equal to (n-1) // 2.
- Therefore, the minimum number of moves needed to reach a square that contains N is (n-1) // 2 + 1.
