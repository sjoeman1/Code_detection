```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()
min_instability = abs(a[0] - a[-1])

for i in range(n):
    b = a.copy()
    b.remove(a[i])
    instability = abs(b[0] - b[-1])
    if instability < min_instability:
        min_instability = instability

print(min_instability)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Sort the array $a$ in ascending order.
2. Calculate the instability of the sorted array, which is the difference between the first and last elements.
3. Iterate over the array and remove each element.
4. Calculate the instability of the remaining array.
5. Update the minimum instability if necessary.
6. Print the minimum instability.
