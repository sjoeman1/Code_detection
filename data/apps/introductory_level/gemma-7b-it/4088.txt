```python
import sys
read = sys.stdin.readline

q = int(read())

for _ in range(q):
    s = read().strip()
    m = int(read())
    b = list(map(int, read().strip().split()))

    # Find any possible string t that satisfies the requirements
    t = ""
    # Create a dictionary to store the character distances
    distances = {}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        distances[s[i]] = i

    # Iterate over the array b and find the character that is at a distance greater than the current character
    for i in range(m):
        character = t[b[i]]
        t = t.replace(character, "", 1) + character

    print(t)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads the string `s`, the length `m` of the array `b`, and the array `b`.
* It then creates a dictionary `distances` to store the character distances.
* Iterate over the array `b` and find the character that is at a distance greater than the current character.
* Replace the character in `t` with the character at the beginning of `t` that is at a distance greater than the current character.
* Print the resulting string `t`.
