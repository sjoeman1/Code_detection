```python
N = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))

h_k = dict()
for i in range(N):
    h_k[i+1] = h[i]

operations = 0
for i in range(1, N+1):
    operations += abs(h_k[i] - h_k[i-1])

print(operations)
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the number of flowers `N`, the heights of each flower `h`, and creates a dictionary `h_k` to store the heights of each flower at its index.
- It then iterates over the range from 1 to `N` and calculates the difference between the height of the flower at index `i` and the height of the flower at index `i-1`.
- The total number of operations is then calculated by summing the absolute value of each difference.
- Finally, the total number of operations is printed.
