## Answer

The solution to this riddle is to find the ceiling of the square root of n. Here's the Python code:

```python
import math

n = int(input())
print(int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the input integer n.
2. Calculate the square root of n using the math.sqrt function.
3. Use the math.ceil function to round up the square root to the nearest integer.
4. Convert the rounded-up integer to an int and print it.

**Time complexity:**

The code calculates the square root of n only once, so the time complexity is O(1).

**Space complexity:**

The code uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size, so the space complexity is O(1).
