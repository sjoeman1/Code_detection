```python
x, k, d = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the minimum absolute value of the destination
min_abs = abs(x - (x - d * k))

# Print the minimum absolute value
print(min_abs)
```

**Explanation:**

- The idea is to calculate the absolute value of the destination coordinate as `abs(x - (x - d * k))`.
- This calculates the distance from the current position `x` to the destination position `x - d * k`, and takes the absolute value.
- The minimum absolute value is then printed.

**Time complexity:**

- The code reads the input in constant time.
- The calculation of the absolute value takes constant time.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(1).

**Space complexity:**

- The code uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
