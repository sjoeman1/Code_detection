```python
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def f(m):
    res = 0
    for i in a:
        res += (m % i)
    return res

print(max(f(x) for x in range(1, 10**5 + 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

- The code reads the number of test cases, N, and then reads the N integers in the list a.
- The function f(m) calculates the sum of (m % a_i) for each element a_i in the list a.
- The code finds the maximum value of f(m) by iterating over the range of values from 1 to 10^5 and taking the maximum of the results.

**Time complexity:**

- The code iterates over the range of values from 1 to 10^5, so the time complexity is O(10^5).

**Space complexity:**

- The code uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.
