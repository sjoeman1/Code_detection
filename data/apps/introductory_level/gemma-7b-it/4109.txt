**Explanation:**

* The code calculates the maximum increase in understanding level for each book.
* It then calculates the minimum number of books to buy.
* If the number of books to buy is less than or equal to the number of books available, the code calculates the total cost of buying the books.
* Otherwise, the code returns -1 to indicate that the objective is not achievable.

**Time complexity:**

* The code calculates the maximum increase in understanding level for each book only once, so the time complexity is O(m).
* The code calculates the minimum number of books to buy in linear time, so the time complexity is O(n).
* The code calculates the total cost of buying the books in linear time, so the time complexity is O(n).

**Space complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the input data.
