```python
import sys

# Read the number of test cases
n = int(sys.stdin.readline())

# Read the rolls for each test case
rolls = []
for _ in range(n):
    d1, d2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    rolls.append([d1, d2])

# Check if there are at least three consecutive doublets
for i in range(n-2):
    if rolls[i][0] == rolls[i+1][0] and rolls[i][0] == rolls[i+2][0] and rolls[i][0] == rolls[i+1][1] and rolls[i][0] == rolls[i+2][1]:
        print("Yes")
        sys.exit()

# If no consecutive doublets are found, print No
print("No")
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of test cases `n` and then reads the rolls for each test case, storing them in a list `rolls`.
* It iterates over the `rolls` list from the second roll to the fourth roll, checking if the first number in each roll is equal to the first number in the previous two rolls, and if the second number in each roll is equal to the second number in the previous roll.
* If all three conditions are met, it prints "Yes" and exits the program.
* If the loop completes without finding any consecutive doublets, it prints "No".
