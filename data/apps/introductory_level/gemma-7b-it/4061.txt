```python
s = input().strip()
t = input().strip()

# Find the maximum length of the substring that can be removed
# such that t is still a subsequence of s
max_len = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    # Check if the substring s[i:i+1] is a subsequence of t
    if s[i:i+1] in t and max_len < i+1:
        max_len = i+1

# Print the maximum length of the substring that can be removed
print(max_len)
