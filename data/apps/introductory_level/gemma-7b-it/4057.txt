```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split().strip().split()))

a.sort()
c = 1
ans = 0
prev = a[0]

for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != prev:
        c += 1
        prev = a[i]

print(c)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of coins and the values of each coin.
* It sorts the coins by value.
* It keeps track of the previous coin value and the number of pockets used.
* If the current coin value is different from the previous coin value, it increments the number of pockets used.
* The number of pockets used is printed.
