```python
N = int(input())

d = list(map(int, input().split()))

K = int((N-2) // 2)

print(len(set(d) & set(range(K+1, d[-1]+1))))
```

**Explanation:**

* We need to find the number of problems with difficulty K or higher and the number of problems with difficulty lower than K.
* We can use a set `set(d)` to store the difficulties of the problems and a range of numbers from `1` to `K` to represent the difficulties of the problems that are lower than K.
* The intersection of the two sets will give us the number of problems that have difficulty K or higher and the number of problems that have difficulty lower than K.
* The number of choices of K is the number of elements in the intersection.
