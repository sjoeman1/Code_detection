```python
import math

k = int(input())

# Find the multiple of K in the sequence
for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(k)) + 1):
    if k % i == 0:
        position = i
        break

# If no multiple of K is found, print -1
if position == None:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(position)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input value `k`, which represents the number of the multiple of K to search for in the sequence.
* It finds the square root of `k` and iterates over the range from 1 to the square root of `k`.
* If the loop finds a multiple of `k`, the position of the multiple is stored in the variable `position`.
* If no multiple of `k` is found, `position` is `None`.
* Finally, the code prints the value of `position`.

**Sample Input:**

```
101
```

**Sample Output:**

```
4
```

**Explanation:**

* The sequence is 7, 77, 777, ..., and there is no multiple of 101 in the sequence.
* The code finds the first multiple of 101 in the sequence, which is the fourth element.
