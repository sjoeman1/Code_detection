```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    d = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if 1 not in d and x not in d:
        print(-1)
    else:
        x = min(d)
        print(x)
```

**Explanation:**

* We read the number of queries and for each query, read the number of divisors and the list of divisors.
* If the list does not contain 1 and the guessed number, we print -1.
* Otherwise, we find the minimum possible number that satisfies the list of divisors and print that number.
