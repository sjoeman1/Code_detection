```python
n = int(input())
w = input().split()

# Calculate the length of the shortest possible abbreviation
min_length = float('inf')
for i in range(n):
    # Calculate the length of the segment
    segment_length = sum(len(w[j]) for j in range(i, n))

    # Update the minimum length if necessary
    if segment_length < min_length:
        min_length = segment_length

# Print the minimum length
print(min_length)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code calculates the length of the segment for each word in the text.
* The code finds the minimum length of the segment that is equal to the length of the shortest possible abbreviation.
* The code updates the minimum length if necessary.
* Finally, the code prints the minimum length.
