```python
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())

s = ""
a_count, b_count, x_count = 0, 0, 0

# Construct the string with a zeroes, b ones and x indices of non-equality
for i in range(a):
    s += "0"
a_count += a

for i in range(b):
    s += "1"
b_count += b

for i in range(x):
    s = s.replace("0", "1", 1)
    x_count += 1

# Print the constructed string
print(s)
```

**Explanation:**

* Read the three integers $a$, $b$ and $x$.
* Initialize variables `a_count`, `b_count` and `x_count` to 0, 0 and 0 respectively.
* Construct the string `s` with a zeroes, b ones and x indices of non-equality.
* For each index `i` in the range `x`, replace the first occurrence of "0" in `s` with "1".
* Increment `x_count` by 1 for each index of non-equality.
* Finally, print the constructed string `s`.
