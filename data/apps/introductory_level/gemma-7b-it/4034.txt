```python
n = int(input())
s = input().lower()

# Check if the string can be sorted
if sorted(s) == s:
    print("YES")
    print("".join(["0" if i == s[i-1] else "1" for i in range(len(s))]))
else:
    print("NO")
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input and stores the length of the string and the string itself.
* It checks if the string can be sorted by comparing it with the sorted string.
* If the strings are equal, it prints "YES" and the coloring.
* Otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Time complexity:**

* The code reads the input in constant time.
* The code checks if the string can be sorted in constant time.
* The code prints the output in constant time.

**Space complexity:**

* The code uses a constant amount of space.
