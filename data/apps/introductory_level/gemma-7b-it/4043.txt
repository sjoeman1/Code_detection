```python
n, d, k = map(int, input().split())

if d > n-1 or k > n-1:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n-1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((u, v))
    print(*edges)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input values $n$, $d$, and $k$.
* If the diameter $d$ is greater than $n-1$ or the degree $k$ is greater than $n-1$, it prints "NO".
* Otherwise, it prints "YES" and then constructs a tree satisfying the conditions.
* The edges of the tree are read from the input and stored in the `edges` list.
* The tree is printed by printing the edges in the format `u` and `v`, where `u` and `v` are the vertices connected by the edge.
