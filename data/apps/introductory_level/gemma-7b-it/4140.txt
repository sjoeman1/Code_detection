```python
n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

# Count the number of adjacent pairs of tiles with the same color
num_pairs = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    if s[i] == s[i+1]:
        num_pairs += 1

# Calculate the minimum number of tiles to repaint
min_repaint = num_pairs

# Print the minimum number of tiles to repaint
print(min_repaint)
