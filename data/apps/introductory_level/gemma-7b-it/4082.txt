```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the maximum length of the increasing subarray
# using Kadane's algorithm
max_length = 1
curr_length = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i):
        if a[j] < a[i]:
            curr_length = max(curr_length, 1 + max_length)
    max_length = max(max_length, curr_length)

# Print the maximum length of the increasing subarray
print(max_length)
```

**Explanation:**

* The algorithm calculates the maximum length of the increasing subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
* The algorithm iterates over the array and maintains a current length of the increasing subarray.
* The current length is updated if the length of the increasing subarray is greater than the current length.
* The maximum length of the increasing subarray is updated if the current length is greater than the maximum length.
* Finally, the maximum length of the increasing subarray is printed.
