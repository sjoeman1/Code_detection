```python
n = int(input())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
edges = []
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)
    edges.append((a, b))

max_edges = 0
a, b, c = 0, 0, 0

def dfs(node, visited, current_edges):
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited and current_edges < max_edges:
            visited.append(neighbor)
            current_edges += 1
            dfs(neighbor, visited, current_edges)

dfs(1, [], 0)

max_edges = dfs(1, visited, 0)

print(max_edges)
print(a, b, c)

```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the input and creates a graph representation of the tree.
* It then calculates the maximum number of edges that belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$.
* The code uses the `dfs` function to traverse the tree and count the number of edges that belong to at least one of the simple paths.
* The code stores the vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$ that were chosen.
* Finally, the code prints the maximum number of edges and the vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$.

**Time complexity:**

The code traverses the tree only once, so the time complexity is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the tree.

**Space complexity:**

The code uses a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the tree.
