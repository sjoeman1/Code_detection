```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

s = sum(a)
good = False
nice = []

for i in range(n):
    if s - a[i] == sum(a[:i]) + sum(a[i+1:]):
        good = True
        nice.append(i+1)

print(len(nice))
print(*nice)

if not good:
    print(0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the total sum of the array `a` and store it in variable `s`.
2. Initialize variables `good` to `False` and `nice` to an empty list.
3. Iterate over the array from 0 to `n-1`.
4. For each element at index `i`, check if the sum of the remaining elements is equal to `s - a[i]`. If it is, update `good` to `True` and append `i+1` (index of the element) to the `nice` list.
5. After iterating over the entire array, print the number of nice indices and the nice indices.
6. If no nice indices are found, print `0` and leave the second line empty.
