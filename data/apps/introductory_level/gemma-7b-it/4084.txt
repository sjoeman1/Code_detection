```python
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of blue balls that will be placed in the first N balls
num_blue = min(a, n)

# Print the number of blue balls
print(num_blue)
```

**Explanation:**

- The number of blue balls that will be placed in the first N balls is equal to the minimum of A and N.
- This is because A blue balls will be placed at the end of the row in each operation, and the number of red balls that will be placed is also equal to A. Therefore, the number of blue balls that will be placed in the first N balls is equal to the minimum of A and N.
