```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()
teams = 0
current_team = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] - current_team <= 5:
        current_team += a[i]
        teams += 1
    else:
        current_team = a[i]
        teams += 1

print(teams)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort the list of programming skills:** Sort the list `a` in ascending order.
2. **Initialize variables:**
   - `teams` is initialized to 0.
   - `current_team` is initialized to 0. This keeps track of the total programming skill of the current team.
   - Loop through the list of programming skills.
3. **Form teams:**
   - If the current programming skill is within 5 units of the current team's total skill, add the student's programming skill to the current team and increment `teams` by 1.
   - Otherwise, start a new team with the student's programming skill and add it to the current team. Increment `teams` by 1.
4. **Print the result:** Print the total number of students in teams.
