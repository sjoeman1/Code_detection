```python
n = int(input())
s = input()

def solve(n, s):
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        sub_s = s[i:i + 2]
        if sub_s == '(())':
            res += 1
    return res

print(solve(n, s) % 1000000007)
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `solve(n, s)` calculates the number of regular bracket sequences containing the given bracket sequence `s` as a substring.
- It iterates over the length of `s` and checks if the subsequence of two characters is equal to '(())'. If it is, it increments the `res` variable.
- Finally, the total number of regular bracket sequences is printed modulo $10^9+7.
