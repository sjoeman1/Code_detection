```python
n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
num = int(input())

# Calculate the remainder when num is divided by 10^x
rem = num % (10**x)

# Calculate the minimum number of operations to get the desired remainder
operations = abs(rem - 10**y) // 10**x + 1

# Print the minimum number of operations
print(operations)
```
