```python
s = input().lower()
t = input().lower()

# Find the maximum length of the substring that can be removed
# such that t is still a subsequence of s
max_length = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    # Check if the substring s[i:i+1] is a subsequence of t
    if s[i:i+1] in t and max_length < 1:
        max_length = 1
    # Check if the substring s[i:i+k] is a subsequence of t
    for k in range(2, len(s) - i + 1):
        substring = s[i:i+k]
        if substring in t and max_length < k:
            max_length = k

# Print the maximum length of the substring that can be removed
print(max_length)
```

**Explanation:**

The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Iterate over the string $s:** We iterate over the string $s to find the maximum length of the substring that can be removed.
2. **Check if the substring is a subsequence of $t:** For each substring, we check if it is a subsequence of $t. If it is, then we update the maximum length of the substring that can be removed.
3. **Find the maximum length:** Finally, we find the maximum length of the substring that can be removed such that $t$ is still a subsequence of $s.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the string $s. The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the input.
