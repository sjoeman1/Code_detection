```python
n = int(input())
s = input().lower()

# Create a frequency table of the characters
freq = {}
for i in s:
    if i not in freq:
        freq[i] = 0
    freq[i] += 1

# Calculate the minimum number of colors
min_colors = 1 + sum(sorted(freq.values())[-1:])

# Create the coloring
c = []
for i in range(n):
    c.append(1)

# Color the characters according to the frequency
for i in range(n):
    c[i] = freq[s[i]]

# Print the minimum number of colors and the coloring
print(min_colors)
print(*c)
```

**Explanation:**

* The algorithm calculates the frequency of each character in the string.
* The minimum number of colors is equal to 1 plus the sum of the sorted frequency of the characters.
* The coloring is done according to the frequency of each character.
* The characters are colored the same color if they have the same frequency.
