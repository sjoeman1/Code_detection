```python
n = int(input())

segments = []
for _ in range(n):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    segments.append((l, r))

segments.sort()

# Remove one segment
segments.pop(0)

# Calculate the intersection
intersection = max(range(segments[0][0], segments[-1][1] + 1))

# Print the length of the intersection
print(intersection)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort the segments** in ascending order based on their left endpoints.
2. **Remove one segment** from the sorted list.
3. **Calculate the intersection** of the remaining segments using the `max` function on the range between the left endpoint of the first segment and the right endpoint of the last segment.
4. **Print the length of the intersection.**

**Time Complexity:**

* Sorting the segments takes O(nlogn) time, where n is the number of segments.
* Calculating the intersection takes O(n) time, where n is the number of segments.

**Space Complexity:**

* The algorithm uses an additional list `segments` to store the segments, which has a space complexity of O(n).
