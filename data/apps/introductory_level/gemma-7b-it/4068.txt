```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[0] = 1

for i in range(m):
    dp[a[i]] = 0

dp[n] = 1

print(dp[n] % 1000000007)
```

**Explanation:**

- The function calculates the number of ways to climb up the stairs, dp, using a dynamic programming approach.
- The base case is dp[0] = 1, as there is only one way to climb up 0 steps, which is to not climb at all.
- For each step a[i], the function sets dp[a[i]] to 0 to prevent counting it in the total number of ways.
- Finally, dp[n] is calculated, which represents the total number of ways to climb up the stairs, excluding the broken steps.
- The result is printed modulo 1000000007 to ensure that the answer does not exceed this limit.
