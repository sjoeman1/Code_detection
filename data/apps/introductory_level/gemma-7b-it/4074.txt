```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of packages
    min_packages = int((n - 1) // k) + 1

    # Print the answer
    print(min_packages)
```

**Explanation:**

* The loop iterates over the number of test cases.
* For each test case, read the number of shovels and packages.
* Calculate the minimum number of packages by dividing $n - 1$ by $k$ and adding 1 to the result.
* Print the minimum number of packages.
