```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
t = input().strip()

# Calculate the minimum length of the string
min_length = (k - 1) // n + 1

# Construct the string
s = ""
for _ in range(min_length):
    s += t

# Print the answer
print(s)
```

**Explanation:**

* The minimum length of the string is equal to the number of substrings of $t$ plus one, minus one. This is because we need to have exactly $k$ substrings of $t$, and the minimum length of a substring is one character.
* We construct the string by repeating $t$ for a total of $min_length$ times.
* The number of substrings of $s$ equal to $t$ is equal to the number of occurrences of $t$ in the string $s$.
* The answer is always unique because there is only one way to construct the string $s$ with the required number of substrings of $t$.
