```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the minimum number of operations
    res = min(abs(a - b) + abs(b - c), abs(a - c) + abs(c - b))

    # Print the minimum number of operations
    print(res)

    # Print the triple
    print(a, b, c)
    print()
```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
* It calculates the minimum number of operations required to obtain three integers $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that $B$ is divisible by $A$ and $C$ is divisible by $B$.
* The minimum number of operations is the minimum of the absolute difference between $a$ and $b$, and the absolute difference between $b$ and $c$.
* The code prints the minimum number of operations and the triple $A$, $B$, and $C$.
