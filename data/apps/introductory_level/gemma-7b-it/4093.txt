```python

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(max((m - n) // 2, 0))

```

**Explanation:**

* The sum of the array is given by the variable `m`.
* The length of the array is given by the variable `n`.
* We can maximize the sum of absolute differences between adjacent elements by subtracting `n` from `m` and dividing the result by 2. This is because we need to distribute the elements of the array as evenly as possible between adjacent elements.
* If the result is negative, it means that it is not possible to achieve the required sum of absolute differences. Therefore, we print 0.

**Time complexity:**

* The time complexity of this code is O(1) because the code reads the input and calculates the output in constant time.

**Space complexity:**

* The space complexity of this code is O(1) because the code uses a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the input.
