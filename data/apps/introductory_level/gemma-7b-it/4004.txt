```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the minimum difference between elements
diff = min(abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(a, a[0:1] + a[1:]))

# If the minimum difference is 0, it means that the array is already equal
if diff == 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(diff)
```

**Explanation:**

* The code calculates the minimum difference between elements in the array `a`.
* If the minimum difference is 0, it means that the array is already equal.
* Otherwise, the code prints the minimum difference.
