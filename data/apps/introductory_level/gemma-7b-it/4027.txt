```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

sum_a = sum(a)
mid = sum_a // 2

ans = abs(sum_a - 2 * mid)

print(ans)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Read the number of elements $n$ and the sequence of $n$ integers.
2. Sort the sequence in ascending order.
3. Calculate the total sum of the sequence, $sum_a$, and the midpoint, $mid$, of the sum.
4. Calculate the absolute difference between $sum_a$ and 2 times $mid$. This is the minimum possible value of $|sum(A) - sum(B)|$.
5. Print the result.
