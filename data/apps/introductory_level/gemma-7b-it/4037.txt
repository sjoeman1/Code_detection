```python
n, r = map(int, input().split())

projects = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

projects.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] - x[1])

rating = r

max_projects = 0

for a, b in projects:
    if rating - b >= a:
        max_projects += 1
        rating += b

print(max_projects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort projects by required rating minus change:** This helps us find the projects that can be completed in order, maximizing the number of completed projects.
2. **Maintain current rating:** We need to track our current rating to see if we have enough rating to complete each project.
3. **Complete projects until rating falls below zero:** We continue completing projects until our rating falls below zero, ensuring that we have enough rating before starting each project and maintaining a non-negative rating after completing each project.
4. **Count completed projects:** Finally, we count the number of completed projects to find the maximum possible subset.
