```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

dp = 0
t = 0
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    dp = max(dp, a[i] + t)
    t += 1
    ans = max(ans, dp)

print(ans)
print(*([int](str(t).split())])

```

**Explanation:**

* The code reads the number of problems and days, and then reads the difficulties of each problem.
* It sorts the difficulties in ascending order and then iterates over them.
* It keeps track of the maximum profit and the number of problems solved on each day.
* The code calculates the maximum profit for each day by adding the difficulty of the problem being solved with the maximum profit achieved on the previous day.
* The code updates the maximum profit and the number of problems solved on each day.
* Finally, the code prints the maximum profit and the number of problems solved on each day.
