 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def solution(n):
    count = 0
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(solution(n))
```

This solution uses a while loop to continuously apply the rules of the riddle to the input number until it reaches 1. The number of iterations it takes to reach 1 is then returned as the output.
