 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [1] + [0]*n
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i):
        if a[i] > a[j]*2:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]+1)

print(max(dp))
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum number of problems that can be included in a valid contest ending at the `i`-th problem. For each problem, we check all previous problems and if their difficulty is less than half of the current problem's difficulty, we update the current problem's value in the `dp` array. Finally, we print the maximum value in the `dp` array which represents the maximum number of problems in the contest.
