 Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
# Read the input integer
a = int(input())

# Calculate the output integer
output = 0
while (2**output < a):
    output += 1

# Print the output integer
print(output)
```

This code reads an integer `a` from the input, then calculates the smallest non-negative integer `output` such that `2**output` is greater than or equal to `a`. The code then prints the value of `output`.

Explanation of the code:

* The first line reads an integer `a` from the input using the `input()` function and the `int()` function.
* The next line initializes the variable `output` to 0.
* The `while` loop calculates the smallest integer `output` such that `2**output` is greater than or equal to `a`.
* The final line prints the value of `output`.

Example run:

Suppose the input is `4`. Then:

* The first line reads the integer `4` from the input.
* The variable `output` is initialized to 0.
* The `while` loop executes with `output` equal to 0. Since `2**0` is not greater than or equal to `4`, the loop increments `output` to 1.
* The `while` loop executes with `output` equal to 1. Since `2**1` is not greater than or equal to `4`, the loop increments `output` to 2.
* The `while` loop executes with `output` equal to 2. Since `2**2` is equal to `4`, the loop terminates.
* The final line prints the value of `output`, which is 2.
