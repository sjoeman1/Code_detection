 Here's the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
# Read the input number
n = int(input())

# Calculate the number of 1000-yen bills needed
num_1000_yen_bills = n // 1000

# Calculate the remaining change
change = n % 1000

# Print the change
print(change)
```

This code first reads the input number `n` from Standard Input. It then calculates the number of 1000-yen bills needed to pay for the product by performing integer division (`//`) of `n` by 1000. The remaining change is calculated as the remainder of the division (`%`). Finally, the code prints the change as an integer.
