 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def min_watering_operations(n, h):
    # Initialize the flower heights
    flower_heights = [0] * (n+1)

    # Calculate the target heights
    target_heights = [0] + h

    # Initialize the watering operations to 0
    watering_ops = 0

    # Create a defaultdict to store the range of flowers that need to be watered
    flowers_to_water = defaultdict(int)

    # Iterate over the target heights
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        # If the current target height is already achieved, continue to the next flower
        if flower_heights[i] == target_heights[i]:
            continue

        # Calculate the number of watering operations required to achieve the target height
        num_ops = target_heights[i] - flower_heights[i]

        # Update the watering operations
        watering_ops += num_ops

        # Update the flowers to water
        flowers_to_water[(i-num_ops) + 1] = num_ops
        flowers_to_water[i] -= num_ops

        # Update the flower heights
        flower_heights[i] = target_heights[i]

    # Check if there are any flowers left to water
    if flowers_to_water:
        # Find the flower with the minimum left endpoint
        min_left = min(flowers_to_water.keys())

        # Find the flower with the maximum left endpoint
        max_left = max(flowers_to_water.keys())

        # Find the flower with the maximum right endpoint
        max_right = max(flowers_to_water.values()) + min_left - 1

        # Calculate the number of additional watering operations required
        additional_ops = max_right - max_left + 1

        # Update the watering operations
        watering_ops += additional_ops

    # Print the minimum number of watering operations required
    print(watering
