 Here's a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
N = int(input().strip())
doublets_in_a_row = 0
for _ in range(N):
    dice1, dice2 = map(int, input().strip().split())
    if dice1 == dice2:
        doublets_in_a_row += 1
    else:
        doublets_in_a_row = 0
    if doublets_in_a_row >= 3:
        print("Yes")
        break
else:
    print("No")
```

This solution reads the number of rolls `N` and then processes each roll by reading two dice values and checking if they are the same. If they are, it increments the counter for doublets in a row; otherwise, it resets the counter. If the counter reaches 3 or more, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop. If the loop finishes without finding 3 doublets in a row, it prints "No".
