 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def min_product_mod_k(l, r, k=2019):
    # The smallest number not divisible by k in the range [a, b] is a + k - (a % k)
    # So we can find the smallest number i in the range that is not divisible by k
    # Then j = i + 1 will also be not divisible by k, and i * j will be minimum
    i = l + k - (l % k)
    if i > r:
        return 0
    return i * (i + 1) % k

l, r = map(int, input().split())
print(min_product_mod_k(l, r))
```

This solution first calculates the smallest number `i` in the range that is not divisible by `k` (2019 in this case), by adding `k` to `l` and adjusting the result to be in the range if necessary. Then it sets `j` to be `i + 1`, which is also not divisible by `k`. Finally, it calculates `i * j` and takes the modulus with `k` to get the answer.
