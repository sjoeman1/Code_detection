 Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
def main():
    # Read the input string
    s = input()

    # Check if the string can be rearranged to form a number with increasing digits
    if ''.join(sorted(s)) == s:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

# Call the main function
main()
```

This code works by reading the input string and then sorting its characters in ascending order. If the sorted string is equal to the original string, then the string can be rearranged to form a number with increasing digits. Otherwise, it cannot.
