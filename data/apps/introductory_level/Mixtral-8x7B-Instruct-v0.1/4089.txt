 Here is a Python function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding name of the dog:

```python
def dog_name(n):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the name
    name = ''

    # Keep dividing n by 26 and updating the name until n becomes 1 or less
    while n > 1:
        # Compute the remainder of n divided by 26
        rem = (n - 1) % 26

        # If the remainder is 0, set it to 26 and subtract 1 from the quotient
        if rem == 0:
            rem = 26
            n = n // 26 - 1
        else:
            n = n // 26

        # Add the corresponding letter to the name
        if rem > 0:
            name = chr(ord('a') + rem - 1) + name
        else:
            name = 'z' + name

    # If n is 1, the name is 'a'
    if n == 1:
        name = 'a' + name

    return name
```

You can test the function using the sample input:

```python
print(dog_name(2))  # Output: 'b'
```

The function works by repeatedly dividing `n` by 26 and computing the remainder until `n` becomes 1 or less. The remainder is used to determine the next letter to add to the name, starting from 'a' and going up to 'z'. If the remainder is 0, the next letter is 'z', and 1 is subtracted from the quotient. Once `n` becomes 1, the name is 'a'.
