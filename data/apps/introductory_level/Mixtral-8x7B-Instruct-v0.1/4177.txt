 Here is a simple Python3 code that solves the problem:

```python
# Read the string from standard input
S = input()

# Replace every character in S with 'x'
result = ''
for char in S:
    result += 'x'

# Print the result
print(result)
```

You can also use the `replace()` method of the string class to achieve the same result in a single line:

```python
# Read the string from standard input
S = input()

# Replace every character in S with 'x'
result = S.replace(S, 'x')

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In both cases, the program reads a string from standard input, replaces every character in the string with 'x', and prints the result.
