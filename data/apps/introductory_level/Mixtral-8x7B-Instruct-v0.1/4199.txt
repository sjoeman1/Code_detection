 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
# Read in the number of friends and the minimum height requirement
N, K = map(int, input().split())

# Read in the heights of the friends
heights = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Count the number of friends who can ride the roller coaster
num_can_ride = sum(h >= K for h in heights)

# Print the result
print(num_can_ride)
```

This solution reads in the number of friends and the minimum height requirement from standard input, then reads in the heights of the friends. It uses a list comprehension to create a boolean list indicating which friends can ride the roller coaster, then uses the `sum` function to count the number of `True` values in the list. Finally, it prints the result.
