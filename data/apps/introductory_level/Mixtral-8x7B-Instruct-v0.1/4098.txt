 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the list of students by their skill level
a.sort()

# Initialize the maximum total number of students
max_students = 0

# Iterate through all possible numbers of teams from 1 to k
for num_teams in range(1, min(k, n//2 + 1)):
    # Calculate the maximum skill level of a student in a team
    max_skill = a[n - 2*num_teams]
    # Initialize the total number of students in teams
    teams_students = 0
    # Iterate through the sorted list of students
    for i in range(n - 2*num_teams + 1):
        # Calculate the minimum skill level of a student in a team
        min_skill = a[i]
        # Check if the difference in skill level between the two students is within 5
        if max_skill - min_skill <= 5:
            # Add the two students to a team
            teams_students += 2
            # Update the maximum skill level of a student in a team
            max_skill = a[i + num_teams - 1]
    # Update the maximum total number of students
    max_students = max(max_students, teams_students)

# Print the maximum total number of students
print(max_students)
```

This solution sorts the list of students by their skill level and then iterates through all possible numbers of teams from 1 to k. For each number of teams, it calculates the maximum and minimum skill level of a student in a team and checks if the difference in skill level between the two students is within 5. If it is, it adds the two students to a team and updates the maximum skill level of a student in a team. It then updates the maximum total number of students and repeats the process for the next number of teams. Finally, it prints the maximum total number of students.

Note that the solution assumes that k is less than or equal to n//2 + 1, because if k is greater than n//2 +
