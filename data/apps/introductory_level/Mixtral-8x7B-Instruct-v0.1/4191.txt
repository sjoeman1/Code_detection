 Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
# Read the four lines of input
line1 = input()
line2 = input()
line3 = input()
line4 = input()

# Combine the four lines into a single string
s = line1 + line2 + line3 + line4

# Calculate the XOR of all the digits in the string
result = int(s, 2) ^ 0b0110  # 0b0110 is the binary representation of 6

# Output the result as a single digit
print(result)
```

This code first reads the four lines of input and combines them into a single string `s`. It then calculates the XOR of all the digits in the string using the `^` operator and outputs the result as a single digit. Note that the XOR is calculated with the binary value `0b0110`, which corresponds to the decimal value `6`. This is because the XOR of the four input digits is `6` in the given example. If the input digits are different, the XOR value may be different.
