 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def midpoint(h1, m1, h2, m2):
    # calculate total minutes
    total\_minutes = (h2 - h1) \* 60 + (m2 - m1)
    # divide by 2 to get the difference
    minutes\_difference = total\_minutes // 2
    # calculate new time
    h3 = h1 + minutes\_difference // 60
    m3 = m1 + minutes\_difference % 60
    # adjust time if it's past midnight
    if h3 >= 24:
        h3 -= 24
    # format and print the answer
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h3, m3))

# read input
h1, m1 = map(int, input().split(':'))
h2, m2 = map(int, input().split(':'))

# call the function
midpoint(h1, m1, h2, m2)
```

The solution first calculates the total number of minutes in the contest and then divides it by 2 to get the difference in minutes between the start and the midpoint. It then calculates the new time by adding the difference to the start time and adjusts it if it's past midnight. Finally, it formats and prints the answer.
