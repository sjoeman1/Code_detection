 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return (x != 0) and ((x & (x - 1)) == 0)

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [0] * (1 << 21)
    for x in a:
        for i in range(20, -1, -1):
            if (x >> i) & 1:
                dp[x] |= 1 << i
    need, cur = 0, 0
    for i in range(20, -1, -1):
        if dp[cur] & (1 << i):
            need |= 1 << i
        if is_power_of_two(cur | (1 << i)):
            cur |= (1 << i)
    print(n - sum(need))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    solve()
```

The solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the XOR of all elements seen so far. For each XOR value, we keep track of which bits are set in its binary representation. This allows us to quickly check if a given XOR value can be made a power of two by adding another element.

The `is_power_of_two` function checks if a given number is a power of two by using the bitwise AND operator. A number is a power of two if and only if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation.

The `solve` function first reads the length of the sequence and its elements. It then initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` with zeros. For each element in the sequence, it updates the `dp` array by setting the corresponding bit in the binary representation of the XOR of all elements seen so far.

Next, it initializes two variables `need` and `cur` to zero. The `need` variable keeps track of the number of bits that need to be flipped in order to make the XOR a power of two. The `cur` variable keeps track of the current XOR value.

Finally, it iter
