 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

sorted_a = sorted(a)
min_instability = min(sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[0], sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[1])

print(min_instability)
```

The solution sorts the array and calculates the instability for two cases: when the maximum and minimum elements are adjacent, and when they are not adjacent. The minimum of these two values is the answer.
