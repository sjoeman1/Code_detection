 Here is a simple Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
# Get input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate sum
sum = a + b

# Print output
print(sum)
```

This program first reads two integers from the input, separated by a space, and stores them in the variables `a` and `b`. It then calculates the sum of these two numbers and stores it in the variable `sum`. Finally, it prints the sum as the output.
