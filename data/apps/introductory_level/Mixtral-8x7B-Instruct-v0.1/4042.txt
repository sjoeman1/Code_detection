 Here's the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
import math

def solve():
    x = float(input())
    a = math.floor((x * 9 + 1) / 2)
    b = math.floor(x * 10) % 10
    return a, b

# Read inputs and print the solution
x = input()
a, b = solve()
print(a, b)
```

The `solve()` function calculates the two integers `a` and `b` based on the input floating-point number `x`. It first calculates the integer part of `(x * 9 + 1) / 2` to get `a`, and then calculates the remainder of `x * 10` divided by 10 to get `b`. The main part of the code reads the input and prints the solution using the `solve()` function.
