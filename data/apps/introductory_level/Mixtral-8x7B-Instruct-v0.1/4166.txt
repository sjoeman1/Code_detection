 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
# Read input
N, M = map(int, input().split())
conditions = []
for _ in range(M):
    si, ci = map(int, input().split())
    conditions.append((si, ci))

# Initialize result with -1
result = -1

# Generate all numbers with N digits
# and check if they satisfy the conditions
for i in range(10**(N-1), 10**N):
    if all((cond[0]-1 == divmod(i, 10**(cond[0]-1))[0] % 10 == cond[1]) for cond in conditions):
        result = i
        break

# Print result
print(result)
```

This solution reads the input and stores the conditions in a list. Then, it generates all numbers with N digits by iterating from 10^(N-1) to 10^N-1 and checks if each number satisfies the conditions. If it does, the solution updates the result and breaks the loop. Finally, the solution prints the result.
