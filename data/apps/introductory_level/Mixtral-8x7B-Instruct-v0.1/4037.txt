 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem. This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum size of the subset of projects that Polycarp can complete with a rating of at least `r` after completing the previous project.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n).
```python
n, r = map(int, input().split())
projects = []
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    projects.append((a, b))

dp = [0] * (r + 1)
dp[r] = 0
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    a, b = projects[i]
    for j in range(r, -1, -1):
        if j >= a:
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - a] + 1)
        if j + b >= 0:
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j + b])

print(dp[r])
```
In the above solution, we initialize an array `dp` with size `r + 1` and initialize all elements to `0`. The value of `dp[j]` represents the maximum size of the subset of projects that Polycarp can complete with a rating of at least `j` after completing the previous project.

We iterate over the projects in reverse order and for each project, we check if it is possible to complete the project with the current rating `j`. If it is possible, we update `dp[j]` to be the maximum of the current value and `dp[j - a] + 1` (where `a` is the rating required to complete the project).

Finally, we print the value of `dp[r]` which is the maximum size of the subset of projects that Polycarp can complete with an initial rating of `r`.
