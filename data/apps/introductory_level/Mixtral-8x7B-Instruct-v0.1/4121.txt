 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def can_vova_complete_the_wall(n, a):
    # Check if the wall is already complete
    if max(a) == min(a):
        return "YES"

    # Check if there are any parts of the wall that can be made equal to its neighbors
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if a[i - 1] < a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            a[i] = (a[i - 1] + a[i + 1]) // 2

    # Check if the wall can be made complete after making some parts equal to its neighbors
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if max(a[i - 1:i + 2]) == min(a[i - 1:i + 2]):
            a[i - 1:i + 2] = [max(a[i - 1:i + 2])] * 3
        elif a[i - 1] == a[i + 1]:
            a[i - 1:i + 2] = [a[i - 1] + 1] * 3

    # Check if the wall is now complete
    if max(a) == min(a):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Read input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Print output
print(can_vova_complete_the_wall(n, a))
```

This solution first checks if the wall is already complete, and if not, it tries to make some parts of the wall equal to its neighbors. If this is possible, it then checks if the wall can be made complete after making some parts equal to its neighbors. If the wall is still not complete, it returns "NO".

The solution uses a simple iterative approach and does not require any advanced data structures or algorithms. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of parts in the wall. This is because it makes at most two passes over the array a, first to make
