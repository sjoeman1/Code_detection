 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:
```python
n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Check if it's possible to repost at least one picture in each segment of length k
if x < (n - k + 1) // k:
    print(-1)
else:
    # Greedily repost the kittens with the highest beauty values
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    reposted = a[:x]
    total = sum(reposted)
    for i in range(x, n - k + 1, k):
        # If there are not enough reposted kittens in this segment,
        # repost the kittens with the highest beauty values
        if sum(reposted[i - x:i]) < k:
            reposted[i - x:i] = a[n - x:n]
            total -= sum(reposted[:i - x])
            total += sum(reposted[i - x:i])
    print(total)
```
The solution first checks if it's possible to repost at least one picture in each segment of length k. If not, it prints -1. Otherwise, it sorts the beauty values in descending order and greedily reposts the kittens with the highest beauty values. If there are not enough reposted kittens in a segment, it reposts the kittens with the highest beauty values. The total sum of the beauty values of the reposted kittens is then calculated and printed.
