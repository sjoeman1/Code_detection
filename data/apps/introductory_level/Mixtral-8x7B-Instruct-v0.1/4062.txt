 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
answer = a * d
if b > c:
    answer = max(answer, b * c)
print(answer)
```

Explanation:

* The maximum value of `x * y` is achieved when `x` is at its maximum and `y` is at its minimum, or when `x` is at its minimum and `y` is at its maximum.
* So, the maximum value is either `b * c` or `a * d`, depending on which one is greater.
* We can calculate both values and print the maximum of the two.
