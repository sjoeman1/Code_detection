 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import collections

def most_frequent_two_gram():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()

    # Use collections.defaultdict to count occurrences of each two-gram
    two_gram_count = collections.defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(n-1):
        two_gram_count[s[i:i+2]] += 1

    # Find the two-gram with the maximum count
    max_count = max(two_gram_count.values())
    max_two_grams = [two_gram for two_gram in two_gram_count if two_gram_count[two_gram] == max_count]

    # Print any two-gram with the maximum count
    print(max_two_grams[0])

most_frequent_two_gram()
```

This solution uses the `collections.defaultdict` class to count the occurrences of each two-gram in the input string. It then finds the two-gram with the maximum count and prints it. Note that there may be multiple two-grams with the same maximum count, so we print the first one we find.
