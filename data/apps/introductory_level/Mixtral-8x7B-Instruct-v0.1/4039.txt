 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def can_complete_projects(n, r, projects):
    # Initialize a list to keep track of the rating after completing each project
    ratings = [r]
    
    # Iterate through the projects in reverse order
    for a, b in projects[::-1]:
        # If the rating before the current project is less than the required rating
        if ratings[-1] < a:
            # If the rating becomes negative after completing the project, return False
            if a + b <= 0:
                return False
            # Otherwise, update the ratings list with the new rating
            else:
                ratings.append(a + b)
        else:
            # If the rating is sufficient, update the ratings list with the new rating
            ratings.append(ratings[-1] + b)
    
    # If the final rating is non-negative, return True
