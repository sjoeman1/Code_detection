 Here is a solution using Python 3 that reads the input from standard input and outputs the result to standard output:

```python
import sys

# Read the number of squares
N = int(sys.stdin.readline())

# Read the heights of the squares
heights = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

# Initialize the maximum number of moves
max_moves = 0

# Initialize the current height
current_height = heights[0]

# Initialize the number of moves
moves = 0

# Iterate over the squares
for height in heights:
    # If the current square has a smaller height
    if height < current_height:
        # Continue to the next square
        continue
    # If the current square has the same height
    elif height == current_height:
        # Add 1 to the number of moves
        moves += 1
    # If the current square has a larger height
    else:
        # Update the maximum number of moves
        max_moves = max(max_moves, moves)
        # Reset the number of moves
        moves = 1
        # Update the current height
        current_height = height

# Update the maximum number of moves
max_moves = max(max_moves, moves)

# Print the maximum number of moves
print(max_moves)
```

This solution uses a single pass through the input to find the maximum number of moves. It keeps track of the current height and the number of moves since the last change in height. Whenever the height increases, it checks if the current number of moves is greater than the maximum number of moves seen so far. If it is, it updates the maximum number of moves. At the end, it prints the maximum number of moves.

The solution has a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(1), where N is the number of squares. It reads the input from standard input using the `sys.stdin` object and writes the output to standard output using the `print` function.
