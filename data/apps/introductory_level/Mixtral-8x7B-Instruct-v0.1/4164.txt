 Here is a Python3 program that solves the problem:

```python
import math

# Read the radius from standard input
r = int(input())

# Calculate the area of the circle with radius r
area_r = math.pi * (r ** 2)

# Calculate the area of the circle with radius 1
area_1 = math.pi * (1 ** 2)

# Calculate the ratio of the areas
ratio = area_r // area_1

# Print the result
print(ratio)
```

This program first reads the radius `r` from standard input and converts it to an integer. It then calculates the area of the circle with radius `r` using the formula `pi * r^2`, and the area of the circle with radius 1 using the formula `pi * 1^2`. The ratio of the two areas is then calculated and printed.

Note that the `//` operator is used to perform integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer as required.
