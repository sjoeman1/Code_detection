 To solve this problem, we can notice that the string will eventually become a repetition of the digits 1 to 9, in order, and then repeating. We can calculate the length of this repeating sequence, and then use the value of K to determine which character in the sequence we need to output.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def calculate_sequence_length(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the length of the repeating sequence of digits
    length = 0
    current = 1
    while current <= n:
        length += 1
        current *= 10
    for digit in range(2, 10):
        current = 0
        for _ in range(digit):
            current += 10 ** length
        length *= digit
    return length

def main():
    string, k = input().split()
    k = int(k)

    sequence_length = calculate_sequence_length(9)
    sequence_index = (5 * 10 ** 15) % sequence_length

    # Calculate the K-th character in the sequence
    character_index = k % sequence_length
    current_index = sequence_index
    current_char = "1"
    for _ in range(character_index):
        current_index = (current_index + 1) % sequence_length
        if current_index == 0:
            current_char = "1"
        else:
            current_digit = current_index % 10
            current_char = str(current_digit) * current_index

    print(current_char)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `calculate_sequence_length` function calculates the length of the repeating sequence of digits. It does this by first calculating the length of the sequence for the digit 1, then multiplying that length by each digit from 2 to 9 to get the length of the sequence for each digit.

The `main` function reads the input, calculates the index of the sequence that corresponds to the day after 5 \* 10^15 days, and then calculates the
