 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
v = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Check if the sequence is already /\/\/\/
if n == 2 or (v[0] == v[2] and v[1] == v[3]):
    print(0)
    exit()

# Count the number of distinct elements
distinct_elements = len(set(v))

# If there are more than 2 distinct elements, we need to replace all but 2
if distinct_elements > 2:
    print(n - 2)
    exit()

# Count the number of times each distinct element appears
counts = {el: v.count(el) for el in set(v)}

# If the counts are not equal, we need to replace one of the elements
if counts[list(counts.keys())[0]] != counts[list(counts.keys())[1]]:
    print(1)
else:
    # If the counts are equal, we need to replace half of the elements
    print(n // 2)
```

The solution works by first checking if the sequence is already /\/\/\/. If it is, then we don't need to replace any elements.

If the sequence is not /\/\/\/, we count the number of distinct elements in the sequence. If there are more than 2 distinct elements, then we need to replace all but 2 of them to make the sequence /\/\/\/.

If there are exactly 2 distinct elements, we count the number of times each distinct element appears. If the counts are not equal, then we need to replace one of the elements to make the sequence /\/\/\/. If the counts are equal, then we need to replace half of the elements.

The solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the sequence, because we only need to iterate through the sequence once to count the distinct elements and their counts. The space complexity is also O(n), because we need to store the sequence and the counts.
