 Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
s = input()

if len(s) > 100 or len(s) < 1:
    print("No")
    exit()

for i in range(len(s)):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        if s[i] not in ['L', 'U', 'D']:
            print("No")
            exit()
    else:
        if s[i] not in ['R', 'U', 'D']:
            print("No")
            exit()

print("Yes")
```

This code first checks if the length of the input string is within the given constraints. If not, it immediately prints "No" and exits.

Then, it iterates through each character in the string and checks if it is in the correct position (odd or even) and if it is a valid character ('L', 'R', 'U', or 'D'). If any character does not meet these conditions, it prints "No" and exits.

If the code reaches the end of the loop, it prints "Yes" to indicate that the string is easily playable.
