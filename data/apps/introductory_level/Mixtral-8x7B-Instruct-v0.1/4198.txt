 Here's the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
def price(N, A, B):
    return A * N + B * len(str(N))

def solve():
    A, B, X = map(int, input().split())
    max_int = -1
    max_price = -1
    for N in range(1, 10**9 + 1):
        current_price = price(N, A, B)
        if current_price <= X and current_price > max_price:
            max_int = N
            max_price = current_price
    print(max_int if max_price != -1 else 0)

solve()
```

The code defines a helper function `price(N, A, B)` to calculate the price of an integer `N` with given `A` and `B`. The main function `solve()` reads the input, initializes the maximum integer and price to -1, and iterates through all integers from 1 to 10^9. For each integer `N`, it calculates the price and updates the maximum integer and price if the current price is less than or equal to `X` and greater than the current maximum price. Finally, the function prints the maximum integer if the maximum price is not -1, or 0 otherwise.
