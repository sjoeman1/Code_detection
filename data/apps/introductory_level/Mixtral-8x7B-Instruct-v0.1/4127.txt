 Here's the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
# Read the input values
A, B = map(int, input().split())
B = float(f"0.{B}") # Convert B to a number with two digits after the decimal point

# Compute A * B and truncate its fractional part
result = int(A * B)

# Print the result as an integer
print(result)
```

To use this code, simply copy and paste it into a Python3 interpreter or a text editor, and then input the values of A and B separated by a space. The code will output the result as an integer. For example:
```makefile
$ python3 truncate_multiplication.py
198 1.10
217
```
