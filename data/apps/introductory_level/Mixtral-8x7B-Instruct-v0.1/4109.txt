 Here is a Python3 code that can be used to solve the problem:

```python
def min_cost(N, M, C, A):
    # Initialize the minimum cost to infinity
    min_cost = float('inf')

    # Iterate over all possible values for the understanding level X
    for X in range(0, 101):
        # Initialize the current cost and the current level of understanding
        cost = 0
        cur\_level = [0] * M

        # Iterate over all the books
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            # Initialize the number of new algorithms learned from the current book
            new\_algo = 0

            # Check if the current book can help Takahashi learn any new algorithms
            for j in range(M):
                if cur\_level[j] + A[i][j] > X:
                    continue
                new\_algo += 1

            # If the current book cannot help Takahashi learn any new algorithms, skip it
            if new\_algo == 0:
                continue

            # Calculate the cost of buying the current book
            cost += C[i-1]

            # Update the level of understanding for all the algorithms that can be learned from the current book
            for j in range(M):
                if cur\_level[j] + A[i][j] > X:
                    continue
                cur\_level[j] += A[i][j]

            # If Takahashi can learn all the algorithms with a lower cost, update the minimum cost
            if all(lvl >= X for lvl in cur\_level):
                min\_cost = min(min\_cost, cost)

    # If the minimum cost is still infinity, it means that it is not possible for Takahashi to achieve his objective
    if min\_cost == float('inf'):
        return -1
    else:
        return min\_cost
```

This function takes as input the number of algorithms `M`, the number of books `N`, the prices of the books `C`, and the increase in understanding level for each algorithm `A`. It returns the minimum amount of money needed for Takahashi
