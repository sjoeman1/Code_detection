 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

for a in A:
    if a % 2 == 0 and (a % 3 != 0 and a % 5 != 0):
        print("DENIED")
        exit()

print("APPROVED")
```

The program first reads the number of integers `N` from the input and then reads the integers themselves, storing them in a list `A`.

Then, the program iterates over the elements of `A`, checking if each even number is divisible by 3 or 5. If it finds an even number that is not divisible by 3 or 5, it prints "DENIED" and exits the program.

If the program finishes iterating over `A` without finding any such number, it prints "APPROVED".
