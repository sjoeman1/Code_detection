 Here's the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
import math

def calculate_distance(A, B, H, M):
    # Calculate the angle in radians for the hour hand
    hour_angle = (H + M/60) * (math.pi * 2 / 12)

    # Calculate the angle in radians for the minute hand
    minute_angle = M * (math.pi * 2 / 60)

    # Calculate the difference between the two angles
    diff_angle = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle)

    # If the difference is greater than pi, take the shorter angle
    if diff_angle > math.pi:
        diff_angle = 2 * math.pi - diff_angle

    # Calculate the distance between the hands
    distance = math.sqrt(A**2 + B**2 - 2*A*B*math.cos(diff_angle))

    # Return the distance without units
    return round(distance, 12)

# Read input from Standard Input
A, B, H, M = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the answer
print(calculate_distance(A, B, H, M))
```

This code first calculates the angles in radians for both the hour and minute hands, taking into account the different angular velocities of the two hands. It then calculates the difference between the two angles, and if the difference is greater than pi, it takes the shorter angle. Finally, it calculates the distance between the two hands using the law of cosines, and returns the result with 12 decimal places. The result is then printed to Standard Output.
