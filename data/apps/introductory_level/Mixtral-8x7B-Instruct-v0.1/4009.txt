 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

# Calculate the number to reach, which is 10^y mod 10^x
target = (10 ** y) % (10 ** x)

# Initialize the result as the difference between the length of the number and x
result = n - x

# Check each digit from right to left
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # If the current digit is 0, flip it to 1 and move to the next digit
    if s[i] == '0':
        s = s[:i] + '1' + s[i+1:]
    # If the current digit is 1, we need to flip it to 0 if the target is not 0
    # and the number of flipped digits so far is less than the target
    elif s[i] == '1' and int(s[i-x:i]) < target:
        s = s[:i] + '0' + s[i+1:]
        result += 1
    # If the current digit is 1 and the number of flipped digits so far is equal to the target
    # we have found the optimal solution
    elif s[i] == '1' and int(s[i-x:i]) == target:
        break

print(result)
```

The solution works by first calculating the target number, which is the remainder of 10^y modulo 10^x. Then it initializes the result as the difference between the length of the number and x, because at least that many digits need to be flipped to make the number have the desired remainder.

Next, it checks each digit from right to left. If the current digit is 0, it flips it to 1 and moves to the next digit. If the current digit is 1, it checks if the number obtained by taking the last x digits of the number is less than the target. If it is, it flips the digit and increments the result. If it is not, it checks if the number obtained by taking the last x digits of
