 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import math

def main():
    # Read input
    d, t, s = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate time needed to reach the place
    time_needed = d / s

    # Check if Takahashi will arrive in time
    if time_needed <= t:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution reads the input values `d`, `t`, and `s` from Standard Input, calculates the time needed to reach the place by dividing the distance by the speed, and then checks if this time is less than or equal to the planned meeting time `t`. If it is, then Takahashi will arrive in time, so the solution prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
