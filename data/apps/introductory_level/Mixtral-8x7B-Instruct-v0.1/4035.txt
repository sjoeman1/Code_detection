 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
# Read input A and B
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the minimum price as -1
min_price = -1

# Loop through all possible prices
for price in range(1, 10001):
    # Calculate the tax amounts for the current price
    tax8 = price * 0.08
    tax10 = price * 0.1
    
    # Round down the tax amounts to the nearest integer
    tax8 = int(tax8)
    tax10 = int(tax10)
    
    # Check if the current price satisfies the condition
    if tax8 == A and tax10 == B:
        # If so, update the minimum price
        min_price = price
        break

# Print the minimum price
print(min_price)
```

This program reads the input values of A and B from Standard Input, initializes the minimum price to -1, and then loops through all possible prices from 1 to 10000. For each price, it calculates the tax amounts for the 8% and 10% tax rates, rounds them down to the nearest integer, and checks if they match the input values of A and B. If they do, the program updates the minimum price to the current price and breaks out of the loop. Finally, the program prints the minimum price. If no price satisfies the condition, the minimum price remains -1, which will be printed by the program.
