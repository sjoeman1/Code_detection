 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def solve():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    t = input()
    result = t * k
    if k * n % len(t) != 0:
        result += t[:(k * n) % len(t)]
    print(result)

solve()
```

The solution works as follows:

1. Read the input values `n` and `k` and the string `t` from the input.
2. Initialize the result string as `t` repeated `k` times.
3. Calculate the remainder of the product of `k` and `n` divided by the length of `t`.
4. If the remainder is non-zero, append the first `remainder` characters of `t` to the result string.
5. Print the result string as the output.

The solution is based on the following observations:

1. To get the minimum possible length of the string `s`, we should repeat the string `t` as many times as possible, i.e., `k` times.
2. However, if the product of `k` and `n` is not divisible by the length of `t`, we need to append the remaining characters of `t` to the result string to satisfy the condition of the problem.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `t`.
