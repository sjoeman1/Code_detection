 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem. This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to keep track of the maximum sum of beauty values for the last x pictures, where x ranges from 0 to k-1. Then, for each picture, we add its beauty value to the maximum sum of beauty values for the last k-1 pictures and update the maximum sum of beauty values for the last x pictures, where x ranges from 0 to k-1. If at any point, the maximum sum of beauty values for the last x pictures becomes less than 0, we set it to 0. This is because if a segment of k consecutive pictures has a negative sum of beauty values, then there is no way to satisfy all the conditions in the problem statement.

```python
n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [0] * k
for i in range(k):
    dp[i] = -1

for i in range(k-1, n):
    dp[0] = max(dp[0], 0)
    dp[0] += a[i]
    for j in range(1, k):
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-1])
        if dp[j-1] < 0:
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], 0)
        else:
            dp[j] += a[i]

print(max(dp))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(k), where n is the number of pictures and k is the minimum length of segment with at least one repost in it.
