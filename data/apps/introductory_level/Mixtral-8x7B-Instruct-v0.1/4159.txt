 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def main():
    A, B, K = map(int, input().split())
    for _ in range(K):
        if A > 0:
            A -= 1
        elif B > 0:
            B -= 1
    print(A)
    print(B)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution reads the input values of A, B, and K, and then performs a loop K times, where in each iteration, it checks if Takahashi has any cookies. If he does, it decrements A by 1. If he doesn't, but Aoki does, it decrements B by 1. Finally, it prints the remaining numbers of cookies for Takahashi and Aoki.
