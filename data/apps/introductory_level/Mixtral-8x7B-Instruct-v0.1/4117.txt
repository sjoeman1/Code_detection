 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def can_form_triangle(L: list) -> int:
    N = len(L)
    count = 0
    lengths = defaultdict(int)

    # Count the frequency of each length
    for l in L:
        lengths[l] += 1

    # Iterate over all possible lengths
    for l in lengths:
        # Check if there are at least two other lengths that can form a triangle with this length
        if lengths[l] < 2:
            continue
        for other in set(lengths.keys()) - {l}:
            # Triangle inequality: |a - b| < c < a + b
            if other < l - l or other > 2 * l:
                continue
            count += lengths[l] * (lengths[other] - (other == l)) // 2
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input().strip())
    L = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(can_form_triangle(L))
```

The solution works by counting the frequency of each length in the input list `L`. It then iterates over each length `l` and checks if there are at least two other lengths that can form a triangle with `l`. The triangle inequality is used to filter out lengths that cannot form a triangle. Finally, the solution counts the number of ways to choose three lengths that can form a triangle and prints the result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input list `L`. The space complexity is O(N) due to the use of a dictionary to store the frequency of each length.
