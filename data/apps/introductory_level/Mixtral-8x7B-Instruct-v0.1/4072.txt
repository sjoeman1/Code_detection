 Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
a = int(input())

# Check if the sum of the digits of a is divisible by 3
sum\_of\_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(a))
if sum\_of\_digits % 3 == 0:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

This code takes an integer input `a`, calculates the sum of its digits using a for loop and the `sum()` function, and then checks if the sum is divisible by 3. If it is, the code prints `1`, otherwise it prints `0`.
