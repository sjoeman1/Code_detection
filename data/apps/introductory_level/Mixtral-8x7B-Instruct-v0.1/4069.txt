 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
x, k, d = map(int, input().split())

# If K is odd, then Takahashi's final position will be non-zero
# since he has to make an odd number of jumps. In this case,
# the smallest absolute value of the coordinate of the destination
# will be the smallest possible positive number, which is 1.
if k % 2 != 0:
    print(1)
else:
    # If K is even, Takahashi can make K moves such that his
    # final position is 0. In this case, the smallest absolute
    # value of the coordinate of the destination will be 0.
    print(0)
```

This solution works by noticing that Takahashi's final position will always be a multiple of `d`. Therefore, if `k` is odd, then Takahashi's final position will be non-zero, and the smallest absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be 1. If `k` is even, then Takahashi can make `k` moves such that his final position is 0, and the smallest absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be 0.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1), since all the operations are constant-time. It has a space complexity of O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of memory.
