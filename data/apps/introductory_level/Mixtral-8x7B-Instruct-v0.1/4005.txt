 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def check_overlap(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5, x6, y6):
    # Check if the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets
    if x2 <= x5 or x1 >= x6 or y2 <= y5 or y1 >= y6:
        return "NO"

    # Check if any part of the white sheet is not covered by the black sheets
    if x2 > x5 and x1 < x6 and y2 > y5 and y1 < y6:
        return "YES"

    # Check if the white sheet intersects with either of the black sheets
    if x1 < x5 and x2 > x5 and y1 < y5 and y2 > y5:
        return "YES"
    if x1 < x6 and x2 > x6 and y1 < y6 and y2 > y6:
        return "YES"
    if x1 < x5 and x2 > x5 and y1 < y6 and y2 > y6:
        return "YES"
    if x1 < x6 and x2 > x6 and y1 < y5 and y2 > y5:
        return "YES"

    return "NO"

# Read input
x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
x3, y3, x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
x5, y5, x6, y6 = map(int, input().split())

# Check overlap
print(check_overlap(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5, x6, y6))
```

The `check_overlap` function checks if the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets, if any part of the white sheet is not covered by the black sheets, or if the white sheet intersects with either of the black sheets. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns "YES", otherwise it returns "
