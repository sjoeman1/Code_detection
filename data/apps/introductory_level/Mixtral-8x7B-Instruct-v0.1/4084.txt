 To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the geometric series to calculate the number of blue balls after $10^{100}$ operations. The number of blue balls added after each operation is A, and the number of operations is $10^{100}$. Therefore, the total number of blue balls after $10^{100}$ operations is:

$$\text{number of blue balls} = A \times \frac{1 - (A+B)^{100}}{1 - (A+B)}$$

We can simplify this formula by calculating $(A+B)^{100}$ only once and then calculating the number of blue balls for each query separately.

Here's the Python code for solving the problem:

```python
def solve():
    N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
    p = A + B
    ans = A * (1 - p**100) / (1 - p)
    print(int(ans % (10**9+7)))

# Take input and solve for each test case
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    solve()
```

The time complexity of this solution is $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of test cases. The space complexity is $O(1)$.
