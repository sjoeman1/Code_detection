 Here is the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
import sys

def main():
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(sum(a))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The code first reads the number of integers `n` from the first line of the input. Then, it reads `n` integers from the second line and stores them in a list `a`. Finally, it calculates and prints the sum of the integers in the list `a`.
