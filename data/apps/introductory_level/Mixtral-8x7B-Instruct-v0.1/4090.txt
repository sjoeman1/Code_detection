 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    words = input().split()
    if n == 1:
        print(len(words[0]))
        return

    # Find all pairs of equal segments
    pairs = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 2, n - 1):
            if ' '.join(words[i:j+1]) == ' '.join(words[n-j+i-1:n+i]):
                pairs.append((i, j))

    # If there are no equal segments, just output the length of the text
    if not pairs:
        print(len(' '.join(words)))
        return

    # Sort pairs by length and take the first one
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0])
    i, j = pairs[0]

    # Create the new text by replacing the first segment with its abbreviation
    new_words = words[:i] + [words[i][0].upper() + words[i+1][0].upper() + ''] + words[j+1:]
    print(len(' '.join(new_words)))

solve()
```

The solution first checks if there is only one word in the input. If so, it simply prints the length of that word.

Otherwise, it finds all pairs of equal segments in the input. If there are no such pairs, it prints the length of the original text.

If there are equal segments, it sorts the pairs by length and takes the first one. It then creates a new text by replacing the first segment with its abbreviation (the first letters of the words in the segment, written in uppercase) and prints the length of the new text.
