 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
def polycarp_game(n, nums):
    # Step 1: Find the largest number that is a power of 2 or a multiple of 3
    max_num = max(nums)
    while max\_num % 2 == 0 and max\_num // 2 in nums:
        max\_num //= 2
    while max\_num % 3 == 0 and max\_num // 3 in nums:
        max\_num //= 3

    # Step 2: Build the sequence starting from the largest number
    result = [max\_num]
    while max\_num != 1:
        if max\_num % 3 == 0:
            max\_num //= 3
        else:
            max\_num *= 2
        result.append(max\_num)

    # Step 3: Check if the resulting sequence matches the given sequence
    if result == nums:
        return result

    # Step 4: Find the index of the first number that is different from the given sequence
    for i in range(len(result)):
        if result[i] != nums[i]:
            break

    # Step 5: Swap the first number with the different number
    nums[0], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[0]
    return nums

# Read input
n = int(input())
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Solve the problem
result = polycarp_game(n, nums)

# Print the result
print(*result)
```

The solution consists of four main steps:

1. Find the largest number in the sequence that is a power of 2 or a multiple of 3.
2. Build the sequence starting from the largest number, by repeatedly dividing by 3 or multiplying by 2.
3. Check if the resulting sequence matches the given sequence.
4. If not, find the index of the first number that is different from the given sequence, and swap the first number with the different number.

The function `polycarp_game` implements these steps and returns the
