 It seems like you're asking for a Python3 solution to a problem based on the given Latin text and input/output format. I'll provide the code that solves the problem, but first, let me explain the task.

The Latin text is a riddle, and the input is a list of integers. The task is to find the smallest integer that can be obtained by performing certain arithmetic operations on the given integers. The allowed operations are:

1. Multiply the integer by 2 (Aqua Fortis)
2. Multiply the integer by 3 (Aqua Regia)
3. Subtract 1 from the integer, then square the result (Amalgama)
4. Multiply the integer by 5 and add 1 (Minium)
5. Multiply the integer by 4 and add 2 (Vitriol)

The goal is to find the smallest positive integer that cannot be obtained through these operations.

Now, here's the Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
def apply_operations(n, operations):
    result = set()
    result.add(n)
    for op in operations:
        for r in result:
            result.add(op(r))
    return result

def aqua_fortis(n):
    return n * 2

def aqua_regia(n):
    return n * 3

def amalgama(n):
    return (n - 1) ** 2

def minium(n):
    return 5 * n + 1

def vitriol(n):
    return 4 * n + 2

def philospher_stone(a):
    operations = [aqua_fortis, aqua_regia, amalgama, minium, vitriol]
    candidates = apply_operations(1, operations)
    for num in a:
        candidates = apply_operations(num, operations)
    for i in range(2, max(candidates) + 1):
        if i not in candidates:
            return i

# Read input
input_str = input().strip()
input_nums = [int(x) for x in input_str
