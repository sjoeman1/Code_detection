 Here's the Python3 code to find the base -2 representation of a given integer N:

```python
def base_2_representation(N):
    if N == 0:
        return "0"
    result = ""
    is_negative = N < 0
    if is_negative:
        N = -N
    while N != 0:
        rem = N % (-2)
        if rem < 0:
            rem += 2
            N += 1
        result += str(rem)
        N //= -2
    if is_negative:
        result = "-" + result[1:]
    return result[::-1]

N = int(input())
print(base_2_representation(N))
```

This code defines a function `base_2_representation` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns its base -2 representation as a string. The function first checks if `N` is 0 and returns "0" if that's the case. Otherwise, it initializes an empty string `result` to store the base -2 representation.

The function then checks if `N` is negative, and if so, it negates `N` and sets the `is_negative` flag to `True`. The function then repeatedly calculates the remainder of `N` divided by -2, using the `%` operator, and appends the remainder to `result`. If the remainder is negative, it is added to 2 and 1 is added to `N` to ensure that the remainder is always 0 or 1.

The function then divides `N` by -2 using the `//` operator to get the next digit of the base -2 representation. This process is repeated until `N` is 0.

Finally, if `N` was originally negative, the function prefixes the result with a "-" sign to get the final base -2 representation. The result is then reversed using the `[::-1]` slice notation before being returned.

The main part of the code reads the input integer `N` from Standard Input and calls the `base_2_representation` function to get its base -2 representation. The result is then printed to Standard Output.
