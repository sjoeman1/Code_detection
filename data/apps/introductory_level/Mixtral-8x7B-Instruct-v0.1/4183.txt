 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

N = int(input())
times = list(map(int, input().split()))

l = times[0]
for t in times[1:]:
    l = lcm(l, t)

print(l)
```

This solution first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the given times. The LCM of two positive integers `a` and `b` is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. In other words, it is the smallest number that both `a` and `b` "reach" at the same time when counting from 1.

Therefore, if we start all the clocks at the same time, the hand of every clock will point directly upward again when the number of seconds is equal to the LCM of their individual times.

The `lcm` function in the code calculates the LCM of two positive integers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. The `math.gcd` function from the `math` module is used to calculate the greatest common divisor.

The input is read from standard input as specified in the problem statement. The first line contains the number of clocks `N`, and the second line contains the individual times of the clocks separated by spaces. The result is printed to standard output using the `print` function.
