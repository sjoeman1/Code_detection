 Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:

```python
# Get input number
a = int(input())

# Initialize result as current number
result = a

# If the current number is not interesting, find the next interesting number
if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(a)) % 4 != 0:
    # Increase number until it becomes interesting
    while sum(int(digit) for digit in str(result)) % 4 != 0:
        result += 1

# Print result
print(result)
```

This script first reads the input number `a`. If the sum of its digits is not divisible by 4, it increments the number until it finds the next interesting number (i.e., a number with a sum of digits divisible by 4). Finally, it prints the result.
