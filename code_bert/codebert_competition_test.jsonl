On the other hand, he does not want to create a rapid widening or narrowing of the road, which would lead to car accidents. To avoid that, the Mayor decided that width of the road for consecutive parts should differ by at most 1, i.e. for each i (1 \u2264 i < n) the inequation |s'_{i} + 1 - s'_{i}| \u2264 1 should hold.

Since the number of days in the current may be different from number of days in schedule $t$, Gleb required that the camp's schedule must be altered so that the number of occurrences of $t$ in it as a substring is maximum possible.

This takes $|3 - 2| + |3 - 4| = 2$ seconds.  Go to the coordinates $(1, 1)$ and collect the $0$-th node. This takes $|1 - 3| + |1 - 3| = 4$ seconds.  Go to the coordinates $(7, 9)$ and collect the $2$-nd node. This takes $|7 - 1| + |9 - 1| = 14$ seconds. \n\nIn the second example, the optimal route to collect $2$ nodes is as follows:   Collect the $3$-rd node. This requires no seconds.  Go to the coordinates $(7, 9)$ and collect the $2$-th node. This takes $|15 - 7| + |27 - 9| = 26$ seconds. \n\nIn the third example, Aroma can't collect any nodes.

It takes the train $1$ second to travel to its next station as described.\n\nBob gave Alice a fun task before he left: to deliver $m$ candies that are initially at some stations to their independent destinations using the train. The candies are enumerated from $1$ through $m$. Candy $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq m$), now at station $a_i$, should be delivered to station $b_i$ ($a_i \\neq b_i$). [Image] The blue numbers on the candies correspond to $b_i$ values.

Load the second candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the second candy.  Proceed to station $1$. This step takes $1$ second.  Load the third candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.

There are four kinds of political views:  supporting none of candidates (this kind is denoted as \"00\"),  supporting Alice but not Bob (this kind is denoted as \"10\"),  supporting Bob but not Alice (this kind is denoted as \"01\"),  supporting both candidates (this kind is denoted as \"11\"). \n\nThe direction of the TV channel wants to invite some of these people to the debate. The set of invited spectators should satisfy three conditions:  at least half of spectators support Alice (i.e. $2 \\cdot a \\ge m$, where $a$ is number of spectators supporting Alice and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  at least half of spectators support Bob (i.e. $2 \\cdot b \\ge m$, where $b$ is number of spectators supporting Bob and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  the total influence of spectators is maximal possible. \n\nHelp the TV channel direction to select such non-empty set of spectators, or tell that this is impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 4\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of people who want to take part in the debate as a spectator.\n\nThese people are described on the next $n$ lines. Each line describes a single person and contains the string $s_i$ and integer $a_i$ separated by space ($1 \\le a_i \\le 5000$), where $s_i$ denotes person's political views (possible values \u2014 \"00\", \"10\", \"01\", \"11\") and $a_i$ \u2014 the influence of the $i$-th person.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 maximal possible total influence of a set of spectators so that at least half of them support Alice and at least half of them support Bob. If it is impossible print 0 instead.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n11 6\n10 4\n01 3\n00 3\n00 7\n00 9\n\nOutput\n22\n\nInput\n5\n11 1\n01 1\n00 100\n10 1\n01 1\n\nOutput\n103\n\nInput\n6\n11 19\n10 22\n00 18\n00 29\n11 29\n10 28\n\nOutput\n105\n\nInput\n3\n00 5000\n00 5000\n00 5000\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example $4$ spectators can be invited to maximize total influence: $1$, $2$, $3$ and $6$. Their political views are: \"11\", \"10\", \"01\" and \"00\". So in total $2$ out of $4$ spectators support Alice and $2$ out of $4$ spectators support Bob. The total influence is $6+4+3+9=22$.\n\nIn the second example the direction can select all the people except the $5$-th person.\n\nIn the third example the direction can select people with indices: $1$, $4$, $5$ and $6$.\n\nIn the fourth example it is impossible to select any non-empty set of spectators."}

Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n12\n11 8\n7 5\n\nOutput\n10.0000000000\n\nInput\n3\n1\n1 4 1\n2 5 3\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n6\n2\n4 6 3 3 5 6\n2 6 3 6 5 3\n\nOutput\n85.4800000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons. At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons. During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining. While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that. During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\n\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}

Since the number of days in the current may be different from number of days in schedule $t$, Gleb required that the camp's schedule must be altered so that the number of occurrences of $t$ in it as a substring is maximum possible.

The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (x_1, y_1), and the distress signal came from the point (x_2, y_2).\n\nDue to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is: the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed $v_{\\operatorname{max}}$ meters per second.\n\nOf course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the wind will be defined by the vector (v_{x}, v_{y}) for the nearest t seconds, and then will change to (w_{x}, w_{y}). These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind. Formally, if a dirigible is located at the point (x, y), while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind (u_{x}, u_{y}) is blowing, then after $T$ seconds the new position of the dirigible will be $(x + \\tau \\cdot u_{x}, y + \\tau \\cdot u_{y})$.\n\nGadget is busy piloting the aircraft, so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally.

Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of q possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The i-th operation is described by a string a_{i} of length two and a string b_{i} of length one. No two of q possible operations have the same string a_{i}.\n\nWhen Limak has a string s he can perform the i-th operation on s if the first two letters of s match a two-letter string a_{i}. Performing the i-th operation removes first two letters of s and inserts there a string b_{i}. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string s exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any a_{i}.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length n and perform n - 1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"?

There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows:   \"cab\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ab\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\"  \"cca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\"  \"eea\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\" \n\nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\"."}
