Dogs compete separately of each other and the rules are as follows:\n\nAt the start of the show the dog and the bowls are located on a line. The dog starts at position x = 0 and n bowls are located at positions x = 1, x = 2, ..., x = n. The bowls are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.

More formally, the dog can eat from the i-th bowl after t_{i} seconds from the start of the show or later.\n\nIt takes dog 1 second to move from the position x to the position x + 1. The dog is not allowed to move to the left, the dog runs only to the right with the constant speed 1 distance unit per second. When the dog reaches a bowl (say, the bowl i), the following cases are possible:  the food had cooled down (i.e. it passed at least t_{i} seconds from the show start): the dog immediately eats the food and runs to the right without any stop,  the food is hot (i.e. it passed less than t_{i} seconds from the show start): the dog has two options: to wait for the i-th bowl, eat the food and continue to run at the moment t_{i} or to skip the i-th bowl and continue to run to the right without any stop. \n\nAfter T seconds from the start the show ends. If the dog reaches a bowl of food at moment T the dog can not eat it. The show stops before T seconds if the dog had run to the right of the last bowl.\n\nYou need to help your dog create a strategy with which the maximum possible number of bowls of food will be eaten in T seconds.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nTwo integer numbers are given in the first line - n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 2\u00b710^9) \u2014 the number of bowls of food and the time when the dog is stopped.\n\nOn the next line numbers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 10^9) are given, where t_{i} is the moment of time when the i-th bowl of food is ready for eating.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of bowls of food the dog will be able to eat in T seconds.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\n1 5 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n1 1\n1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the dog should skip the second bowl to eat from the two bowls (the first and the third).", "difficulty": "competition", "original_source": "gpt-4", "label": 1, "label_name": "machine_generated"}

Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n12\n11 8\n7 5\n\nOutput\n10.0000000000\n\nInput\n3\n1\n1 4 1\n2 5 3\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n6\n2\n4 6 3 3 5 6\n2 6 3 6 5 3\n\nOutput\n85.4800000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons. At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons. During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining. While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that. During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\n\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth.", "difficulty": "competition", "original_source": "gpt-4", "label": 1, "label_name": "machine_generated"}
