Some of them require multiple days of hard work.\n\nLet's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $a_{i_1}$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$ pages, ..., the $k$-th cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$ pages.\n\nIf Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.\n\nPolycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it).

It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days in this test.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write $4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6$ pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write $4$ pages) so the answer is $2$.
