He has a list of $n$ problems with difficulties $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $k$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $n$ problems in exactly $k$ days.\n\nThus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $k$ days he will solve all the $n$ problems.\n\nThe profit of the $j$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $j$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $l$ to $r$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $k$ days of his practice.\n\nYou want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $n$ problems between $k$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.\n\nFor example, if $n = 8, k = 3$ and $a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$.

The second segment can be passed using the battery, and charge levels become $b=1$ and $a=1$. The third segment can be passed using the accumulator, and charge levels become $b=1$ and $a=0$. The fourth segment can be passed using the battery, and charge levels become $b=0$ and $a=1$.

For example, if $d=1$, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells $0$ and $n+1$ belong to wooden platforms.\n\nYou want to know if it is possible to reach $n+1$ from $0$ if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.\n\nNote that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).\n\nFor example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:\n\n [Image] The first example: $n=7$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n, m, d \\le 1000, m \\le n$) \u2014 the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n, \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array $a$ of length $n$ in the second line \u2014 the sequence of river cells (excluding cell $0$ and cell $n + 1$).\n\nIf the cell $i$ does not belong to any platform, $a_i$ should be $0$. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.\n\nNote that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$, ..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$, ..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.\n\nSee example outputs for better understanding.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 2\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 1 0 2 2 0 3 \n\nInput\n10 1 11\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nInput\n10 1 5\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$. The sequence of jumps you perform is $0 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 7 \\rightarrow 8$.\n\nConsider the second example: it does not matter how to place the platform because you always can jump from $0$ to $11$.\n\nConsider the third example: the answer is $[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$. The sequence of jumps you perform is $0 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 11$."}

Now it's totally up to Vova to put the finishing touches.\n\nThe current state of the wall can be respresented by a sequence $a$ of $n$ integers, with $a_i$ being the height of the $i$-th part of the wall.\n\nVova can only use $2 \\times 1$ bricks to put in the wall (he has infinite supply of them, however).\n\nVova can put bricks only horizontally on the neighbouring parts of the wall of equal height. It means that if for some $i$ the current height of part $i$ is the same as for part $i + 1$, then Vova can put a brick there and thus increase both heights by 1. Obviously, Vova can't put bricks in such a way that its parts turn out to be off the borders (to the left of part $1$ of the wall or to the right of part $n$ of it).\n\nNote that Vova can't put bricks vertically.\n\nVova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when:  all parts of the wall has the same height;  the wall has no empty spaces inside it. \n\nCan Vova complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero)?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of parts in the wall.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the initial heights of the parts of the wall.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" if Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).\n\nPrint \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n2 1 1 2 5\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3\n4 5 3\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n2\n10 10\n\nOutput\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Vova can put a brick on parts 2 and 3 to make the wall $[2, 2, 2, 2, 5]$ and then put 3 bricks on parts 1 and 2 and 3 bricks on parts 3 and 4 to make it $[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]$.\n\nIn the second example Vova can put no bricks in the wall.\n\nIn the third example the wall is already complete."}

Consider Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $a_{i_1}$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$ pages, ..., the $k$-th cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$ pages.\n\nIf Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.\n\nPolycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it).
