The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\n\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$) \u2014 the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1$) \u2014 the colors of the pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n-1 0 1\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n1 1\n-1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below.

Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.\n\nOne of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to \"true up\". [Image] \n\nThe next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware.

One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.", "difficulty": "interview", "original_source": "gpt-4", "label": 1, "label_name": "machine_generated"}

Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at.
