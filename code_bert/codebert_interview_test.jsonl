One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n\n  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\";  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \n\nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor.

The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\n\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$) \u2014 the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1$) \u2014 the colors of the pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n-1 0 1\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n1 1\n-1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below.

Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$.

Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.\n\nOne of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to \"true up\". [Image] \n\nThe next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware.

One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns."}

So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\n\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\n\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers \u2014 $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct.

For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n#G#T#\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n6 1\nT....G\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n7 3\nT..#..G\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n6 2\n..GT..\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free\u00a0\u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times.\n\nIn the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect."}

To fix it, Leha can add marks [10, 10, 10, 10] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to $\\frac{8 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10}{6} = \\frac{57}{6} = 9.5$. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.\n\nIn the second example Leha can add [5, 5, 5] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate."}

Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$.

Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.\n\nOne of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns."}

But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall.

The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at.

It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).\n\nUnfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability.

Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains two integers x and k (0 \u2264 x, k \u2264 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 0\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n2 1\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n3 2\n\nOutput\n21\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.\n\nIn the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7."}
