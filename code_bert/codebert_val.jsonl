He studies in a special school and his grade can be equal to any positive decimal fraction. First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). \n\nThere are t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.\n\nIn this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit n + 1. If it is less than 5 than the n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the n + 1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position n is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. At the end, all trailing zeroes are thrown away.\n\nFor example, if the number 1.14 is rounded to the first decimal place, the result is 1.1, while if we round 1.5 to the nearest integer, the result is 2.

These two versions differ only in the constraints. Hacks for this version are disabled.\n\nAlice received a set of Toy Train\u2122 from Bob. It consists of one train and a connected railway network of $n$ stations, enumerated from $1$ through $n$. The train occupies one station at a time and travels around the network of stations in a circular manner. More precisely, the immediate station that the train will visit after station $i$ is station $i+1$ if $1 \\leq i < n$ or station $1$ if $i = n$. It takes the train $1$ second to travel to its next station as described.\n\nBob gave Alice a fun task before he left: to deliver $m$ candies that are initially at some stations to their independent destinations using the train. The candies are enumerated from $1$ through $m$. Candy $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq m$), now at station $a_i$, should be delivered to station $b_i$ ($a_i \\neq b_i$). [Image] The blue numbers on the candies correspond to $b_i$ values. The image corresponds to the $1$-st example. \n\nThe train has infinite capacity, and it is possible to load off any number of candies at a station. However, only at most one candy can be loaded from a station onto the train before it leaves the station. You can choose any candy at this station. The time it takes to move the candies is negligible.\n\nNow, Alice wonders how much time is needed for the train to deliver all candies. Your task is to find, for each station, the minimum time the train would need to deliver all the candies were it to start from there.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 100$; $1 \\leq m \\leq 200$) \u2014 the number of stations and the number of candies, respectively.\n\nThe $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains two space-separated integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$; $a_i \\neq b_i$) \u2014 the station that initially contains candy $i$ and the destination station of the candy, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first and only line, print $n$ space-separated integers, the $i$-th of which is the minimum time, in seconds, the train would need to deliver all the candies were it to start from station $i$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 7\n2 4\n5 1\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1\n5 3\n3 5\n\nOutput\n10 9 10 10 9 \n\nInput\n2 3\n1 2\n1 2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n5 6 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the second sample.\n\nIf the train started at station $1$, the optimal strategy is as follows.  Load the first candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the first candy.  Proceed to station $1$. This step takes $1$ second.  Load the second candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the second candy.  Proceed to station $1$. This step takes $1$ second.  Load the third candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the third candy. \n\nHence, the train needs $5$ seconds to complete the tasks.\n\nIf the train were to start at station $2$, however, it would need to move to station $1$ before it could load the first candy, which would take one additional second. Thus, the answer in this scenario is $5+1 = 6$ seconds."}

As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules:  Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below.  During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2.  Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p.  All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p. \n\nWe know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move. Note that the game has exactly k moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly k times.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere.

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain. The barn is empty. \n\nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty."}

A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\n\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator.

Its peak rises to 8848 m.  The largest board game tournament consisted of 958 participants playing chapaev. The largest online maths competition consisted of 12766 participants. The Nile is credited as the longest river in the world. From its farthest stream in Burundi, it extends 6695 km in length. While not in flood, the main stretches of the Amazon river in South America can reach widths of up to 1100 km at its widest points. Angel Falls is the highest waterfall. Its greatest single drop measures 807 m. The Hotel Everest View above Namche, Nepal \u2014 the village closest to Everest base camp \u2013 is at a record height of 31962 m Uranium is the heaviest of all the naturally occurring elements. Its most common isotope has a nucleus containing 146 neutrons. The coldest permanently inhabited place is the Siberian village of Oymyakon, where the temperature of -68\u00b0C was registered in the twentieth century. The longest snake held in captivity is over 25 feet long. Its name is Medusa. Colonel Meow holds the world record for longest fur on a cat \u2014 almost 134 centimeters. Sea otters can have up to 10000 hairs per square inch. This is the most dense fur in the animal kingdom. The largest state of USA is Alaska; its area is 663268 square miles Alaska has a longer coastline than all of the other 49 U.S. States put together: it is 154103 miles long. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in the world. It reaches 1642\u00a0meters in depth and contains around one-fifth of the world\u2019s unfrozen fresh water.

This string is known for you and given in the input.\n\nAfter that, he erased some letters from the string $s$, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string $t$. You have to find it with some additional information.\n\nSuppose that the string $t$ has length $m$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $m$. You are given a sequence of $m$ integers: $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$, where $b_i$ is the sum of the distances $|i-j|$ from the index $i$ to all such indices $j$ that $t_j > t_i$ (consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate $b_i$, Polycarp finds all such indices $j$ that the index $j$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $t_i$ and sums all the values $|i-j|$.\n\nFor example, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then:  since $t_1$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$;  since $t_2$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_2=|2-3|=1$;  since $t_3$='z', then there are no indexes $j$ such that $t_j>t_i$, thus $b_3=0$;  since $t_4$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_4=|4-3|=1$. \n\nThus, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then $b=[6,1,0,1]$.\n\nGiven the string $s$ and the array $b$, find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:  $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;  the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.

The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order.

As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.\n\nAssume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\n\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. \n\nThe first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.\n\nNeko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations.

But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).

He studies in a special school and his grade can be equal to any positive decimal fraction. First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). \n\nThere are t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.\n\nIn this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit n + 1. If it is less than 5 than the n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the n + 1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position n is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. At the end, all trailing zeroes are thrown away.\n\nFor example, if the number 1.14 is rounded to the first decimal place, the result is 1.1, while if we round 1.5 to the nearest integer, the result is 2.

The second integer $y$ is the maximum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to $s$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of fast food restaurants on the circle and the distance between the neighboring restaurants, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \\le a, b \\le \\frac{k}{2}$)\u00a0\u2014 the distances to the nearest fast food restaurants from the initial city and from the city Sergey made the first stop at, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the two integers $x$ and $y$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n1 1\n\nOutput\n1 6\n\nInput\n3 2\n0 0\n\nOutput\n1 3\n\nInput\n1 10\n5 3\n\nOutput\n5 5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the restaurants are located in the cities $1$ and $4$, the initial city $s$ could be $2$, $3$, $5$, or $6$. The next city Sergey stopped at could also be at cities $2, 3, 5, 6$. Let's loop through all possible combinations of these cities. If both $s$ and the city of the first stop are at the city $2$ (for example, $l = 6$), then Sergey is at $s$ after the first stop already, so $x = 1$. In other pairs Sergey needs $1, 2, 3$, or $6$ stops to return to $s$, so $y = 6$.\n\nIn the second example Sergey was at cities with fast food restaurant both initially and after the first stop, so $l$ is $2$, $4$, or $6$. Thus $x = 1$, $y = 3$.\n\nIn the third example there is only one restaurant, so the possible locations of $s$ and the first stop are: $(6, 8)$ and $(6, 4)$. For the first option $l = 2$, for the second $l = 8$. In both cases Sergey needs $x=y=5$ stops to go to $s$."}

Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n12\n11 8\n7 5\n\nOutput\n10.0000000000\n\nInput\n3\n1\n1 4 1\n2 5 3\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n6\n2\n4 6 3 3 5 6\n2 6 3 6 5 3\n\nOutput\n85.4800000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons. At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons. During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining. While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that. During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\n\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}

It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).\n\nIn the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.\n\nIn the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.\n\nIn the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$."}

The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\n\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$) \u2014 the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1$) \u2014 the colors of the pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n-1 0 1\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n1 1\n-1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below.

For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\n\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. \n\nThe first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.\n\nNeko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?\n\nNote that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \\le t \\le 40$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operations to apply.\n\nThen for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\\lceil \\frac{t}{2} \\rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \\le n_i \\le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n39\n\nOutput\n4\n5 3 \nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n7\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \\to 56 \\to 57 \\to 62 \\to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \\oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \\oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. \n\nIn the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement."}

A sequence $[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$ is called an arithmetic progression if for each $i$ ($1 \\le i < n$) the value $a_{i+1} - a_i$ is the same. For example, the sequences $[42]$, $[5, 5, 5]$, $[2, 11, 20, 29]$ and $[3, 2, 1, 0]$ are arithmetic progressions, but $[1, 0, 1]$, $[1, 3, 9]$ and $[2, 3, 1]$ are not.\n\nIt follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.\n\nPolycarp found some sequence of positive integers $[b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n]$. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by $1$, an element can be increased by $1$, an element can be left unchanged.\n\nDetermine a minimum possible number of elements in $b$ which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence $b$ becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.\n\nIt is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals $0$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000)$ \u2014 the number of elements in $b$.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ $(1 \\le b_i \\le 10^{9})$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with described operations, print -1. In the other case, print non-negative integer \u2014 the minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes an arithmetic progression.

So, after Polycarp changed three elements by one, his sequence became equals to $[25, 20, 15, 10]$, which is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp should not change anything, because his sequence is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the third example it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the fourth example Polycarp should change only the first element, he should decrease it on one.
