Thus, the first participant has $(1,2)$ and the second has $(1,5)$, and at this point you already know the shared number is $1$.\n\nIn the second example either the first participant has $(1,2)$ and the second has $(1,5)$, or the first has $(3,4)$ and the second has $(6,4)$. In the first case both of them know the shared number is $1$, in the second case both of them know the shared number is $4$. You don't have enough information to tell $1$ and $4$ apart.\n\nIn the third case if the first participant was given $(1,2)$, they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either $(1,3)$, in which case the shared number is $1$, or $(2,3)$, in which case the shared number is $2$. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is $-1$."}

As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules:  Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below.  During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2.  Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p.  All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p. \n\nWe know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move. Note that the game has exactly k moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly k times.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere.

For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of $n$ non-negative integers.\n\nIf there are exactly $K$ distinct values in the array, then we need $k = \\lceil \\log_{2} K \\rceil$ bits to store each value. It then takes $nk$ bits to store the whole file.\n\nTo reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers $l \\le r$, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range $[l;r]$, we don't change it. If it is less than $l$, we change it to $l$; if it is greater than $r$, we change it to $r$. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.\n\nYour task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size $I$ bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.\n\nWe remind you that $1$ byte contains $8$ bits.\n\n$k = \\lceil log_{2} K \\rceil$ is the smallest integer such that $K \\le 2^{k}$.

Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right).

For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'.

Now players from all over the world can try his level.\n\nAll levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well.

But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} \u2014 the abscissa of his point of aiming. \n\nIf there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them.

As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.\n\nAssume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\n\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. \n\nThe first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.\n\nNeko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?\n\nNote that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \\le t \\le 40$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operations to apply.\n\nThen for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\\lceil \\frac{t}{2} \\rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \\le n_i \\le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n39\n\nOutput\n4\n5 3 \nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n7\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \\to 56 \\to 57 \\to 62 \\to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \\oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \\oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. \n\nIn the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement."}

The $i$-th candy has the weight $a_i$.\n\nShe plans to eat exactly $n-1$ candies and give the remaining candy to her dad. Tanya eats candies in order of increasing their numbers, exactly one candy per day.\n\nYour task is to find the number of such candies $i$ (let's call these candies good) that if dad gets the $i$-th candy then the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in odd days. Note that at first, she will give the candy, after it she will eat the remaining candies one by one.\n\nFor example, $n=4$ and weights are $[1, 4, 3, 3]$. Consider all possible cases to give a candy to dad:  Tanya gives the $1$-st candy to dad ($a_1=1$), the remaining candies are $[4, 3, 3]$.

Since $4 = 4$ this case should be counted to the answer (this candy is good).  Tanya gives the $4$-th candy to dad ($a_4=3$), the remaining candies are $[1, 4, 3]$. She will eat $a_1=1$ in the first day, $a_2=4$ in the second day, $a_3=3$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $1+3=4$ and in even days she will eat $4$.

For each segment, you should choose which type of energy storage robot will use to go to the next point (it can be either battery or accumulator).

At the same time, the number of contest days and days off shouldn't change, only their order may change.\n\nCould you rearrange the schedule in the best possible way?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains string $s$ ($1 \\leqslant |s| \\leqslant 500\\,000$), denoting the current project of the camp's schedule.\n\nThe second line contains string $t$ ($1 \\leqslant |t| \\leqslant 500\\,000$), denoting the optimal schedule according to Gleb.\n\nStrings $s$ and $t$ contain characters '0' and '1' only.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line print the schedule having the largest number of substrings equal to $t$. Printed schedule should consist of characters '0' and '1' only and the number of zeros should be equal to the number of zeros in $s$ and the number of ones should be equal to the number of ones in $s$.\n\nIn case there multiple optimal schedules, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n101101\n110\n\nOutput\n110110\nInput\n10010110\n100011\n\nOutput\n01100011\n\nInput\n10\n11100\n\nOutput\n01\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example there are two occurrences, one starting from first position and one starting from fourth position.\n\nIn the second example there is only one occurrence, which starts from third position.

For example, if we move the first day (which is a day off) to the last position, the number of occurrences of $t$ wouldn't change.\n\nIn the third example it's impossible to make even a single occurrence."}

The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$) \u2014 the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1$) \u2014 the colors of the pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n-1 0 1\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n1 1\n-1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below.

As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total.

Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph G, painted by Vasya. In order to verify this, Petya needs to know whether there exists a string s, such that if Vasya used this s he would produce the given graph G.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m $(1 \\leq n \\leq 500,0 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2})$\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n, u_{i} \u2260 v_{i})\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the graph G. It is guaranteed, that there are no multiple edges, that is any pair of vertexes appear in this list no more than once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if the string s Petya is interested in really exists and \"No\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\nIf the string s exists, then print it on the second line of the output. The length of s must be exactly n, it must consist of only letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" only, and the graph built using this string must coincide with G. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\nYes\naa\n\nInput\n4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample you are given a graph made of two vertices with an edge between them. So, these vertices can correspond to both the same and adjacent letters. Any of the following strings \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\", \"cb\", \"cc\" meets the graph's conditions. \n\nIn the second sample the first vertex is connected to all three other vertices, but these three vertices are not connected with each other. That means that they must correspond to distinct letters that are not adjacent, but that is impossible as there are only two such letters: a and c."}

Before unpacking, Nora decided to make a fun game for ROBO.\n\nShe labelled all $n$ boxes with $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ and asked ROBO to do the following action several (possibly zero) times:\n\n  Pick three distinct indices $i$, $j$ and $k$, such that $a_i \\mid a_j$ and $a_i \\mid a_k$. In other words, $a_i$ divides both $a_j$ and $a_k$, that is $a_j \\bmod a_i = 0$, $a_k \\bmod a_i = 0$.  After choosing, Nora will give the $k$-th box to ROBO, and he will place it on top of the box pile at his side. Initially, the pile is empty.  After doing so, the box $k$ becomes unavailable for any further actions. \n\nBeing amused after nine different tries of the game, Nora asked ROBO to calculate the number of possible different piles having the largest amount of boxes in them. Two piles are considered different if there exists a position where those two piles have different boxes.\n\nSince ROBO was still in his infant stages, and Nora was still too young to concentrate for a long time, both fell asleep before finding the final answer. Can you help them?\n\nAs the number of such piles can be very large, you should print the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 60$), denoting the number of boxes.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 60$), where $a_i$ is the label of the $i$-th box.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of distinct piles having the maximum number of boxes that ROBO_Head can have, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 6 8\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\n2 3 4 9 12\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4\n5 7 2 9\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's illustrate the box pile as a sequence $b$, with the pile's bottommost box being at the leftmost position.\n\nIn the first example, there are $2$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [6]$ ($[2, \\mathbf{6}, 8] \\xrightarrow{(1, 3, 2)} [2, 8]$)  $b = [8]$ ($[2, 6, \\mathbf{8}] \\xrightarrow{(1, 2, 3)} [2, 6]$) \n\nIn the second example, there are $4$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [9, 12]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{12}] \\xrightarrow{(1, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 4]$)  $b = [4, 12]$ ($[2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, 9, \\mathbf{12}] \\xrightarrow{(2, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 9]$)  $b = [4, 9]$ ($[2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$)  $b = [9, 4]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \\mathbf{9}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, \\mathbf{4}, 12] \\xrightarrow{(1, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$) \n\nIn the third sequence, ROBO can do nothing at all.

He studies in a special school and his grade can be equal to any positive decimal fraction. First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). \n\nThere are t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.\n\nIn this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit n + 1. If it is less than 5 than the n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the n + 1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position n is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. At the end, all trailing zeroes are thrown away.\n\nFor example, if the number 1.14 is rounded to the first decimal place, the result is 1.1, while if we round 1.5 to the nearest integer, the result is 2.

Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons. During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining. While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that. During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\n\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}

Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\").

Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn.

The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain.

Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.\n\nOne of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns."}

In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by $1$, an element can be increased by $1$, an element can be left unchanged.\n\nDetermine a minimum possible number of elements in $b$ which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence $b$ becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.\n\nIt is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals $0$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000)$ \u2014 the number of elements in $b$.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ $(1 \\le b_i \\le 10^{9})$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with described operations, print -1. In the other case, print non-negative integer \u2014 the minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes an arithmetic progression. The only allowed operation is to add/to subtract one from an element (can't use operation twice to the same position).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n24 21 14 10\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n2\n500 500\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3\n14 5 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n5\n1 3 6 9 12\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Polycarp should increase the first number on $1$, decrease the second number on $1$, increase the third number on $1$, and the fourth number should left unchanged. So, after Polycarp changed three elements by one, his sequence became equals to $[25, 20, 15, 10]$, which is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp should not change anything, because his sequence is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the third example it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the fourth example Polycarp should change only the first element, he should decrease it on one. After that his sequence will looks like $[0, 3, 6, 9, 12]$, which is an arithmetic progression."}

Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.\n\nA hungry golorp is visiting you.
