If there are multiple answers, you can print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 4 3 2\n\nOutput\n4\nLRRR\n\nInput\n7\n1 3 5 6 5 4 2\n\nOutput\n6\nLRLRRR\n\nInput\n3\n2 2 2\n\nOutput\n1\nR\n\nInput\n4\n1 2 4 3\n\nOutput\n4\nLLRR\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.", "gold_completion": "\nn = int(input())\n\narr = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))\n\nfl = 1\n\nans = \"\"\nc = 0\n\nst = 0\nen = n-1\n\nla = 0\nfloop = 0\nwhile fl:\n    if st>=n or en<=-1:\n        \n        break\n\n    if arr[st]==arr[en]:\n        floop =1\n        break;\n\n    \n    if arr[st] > la:\n        if arr[en]>la:\n            if arr[en] > arr[st]:\n                st+=1\n                la = arr[st-1]\n                ans+=\"L\"\n                c+=1\n            else:\n                en-=1\n                la  = arr[en+1]\n                ans+=\"R\"\n                c+=1\n        else:\n            st+=1\n            la = arr[st-1]\n            ans+=\"L\"\n            c+=1\n    else:\n        if arr[en]>la:\n            en-=1\n            la =arr[en+1]\n            ans+=\"R\"\n            c+=1\n        else:\n            break;\n#print(floop)\nif floop == 1:\n    orig = la\n    cm = 0\n    s1 = \"\"\n    for i in range(st,en+1):\n        if arr[i]>la:\n            la = arr[i]\n            cm+=1\n            s1+=\"L\"\n        else:\n            break;\n    cn = 0\n    s2 = \"\"\n    la = orig\n    for i in range(en,st-1,-1):\n        if la < arr[i]:\n            cn+=1\n            s2+=\"R\"\n            la = arr[i]\n        else:\n            break;\n    if cn>cm:\n        ans+=s2\n    else:\n        \n        ans+=s1\n    c+=max(cn,cm)\n    ##print(s1,s2)\n\n    \n    \nprint(c)\nprint(ans)\n                \n", "gen_completion": "```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\nk = len(set(a))\ns = \"\"\n\nfor i in range(k):\n    if a[i] == a[i-1]:\n        s += \"L\"\n    else:\n        s += \"R\"\n\nprint(k)\nprint(s)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The code reads the number of elements `n` and the sequence `a`.\n* It sorts the sequence in ascending order and removes duplicates, resulting in a sequence of distinct elements.\n* The length of the sequence is stored in `k`.\n* The code constructs a string `s` of length `k`, where 'L' represents taking the leftmost element and 'R' represents taking the rightmost element.\n* The final string `s` is printed.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n* The code spends time sorting the sequence, which takes O(nlogn) time.\n* The code also spends time removing duplicates, which takes O(n) time.\n* Overall, the time complexity is O(nlogn).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\n* The code uses a set to remove duplicates, which has a space complexity of O(n).\n* The code also uses a string of length `k`, which has a space complexity of O(k).\n* Overall, the space complexity is O(n) + O(k).", "parsed_codes": "n = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\nk = len(set(a))\ns = \"\"\n\nfor i in range(k):\n    if a[i] == a[i-1]:\n        s += \"L\"\n    else:\n        s += \"R\"\n\nprint(k)\nprint(s)"}

For the $i$-th exam Petya should prepare in days between $s_i$ and $d_i-1$, inclusive. \n\nThere are three types of activities for Petya in each day: to spend a day doing nothing (taking a rest), to spend a day passing exactly one exam or to spend a day preparing for exactly one exam. So he can't pass/prepare for multiple exams in a day. He can't mix his activities in a day. If he is preparing for the $i$-th exam in day $j$, then $s_i \\le j < d_i$.\n\nIt is allowed to have breaks in a preparation to an exam and to alternate preparations for different exams in consecutive days.

It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.\n\nNote that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).\n\nFor example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:\n\n [Image] The first example: $n=7$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n, m, d \\le 1000, m \\le n$) \u2014 the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n, \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array $a$ of length $n$ in the second line \u2014 the sequence of river cells (excluding cell $0$ and cell $n + 1$).\n\nIf the cell $i$ does not belong to any platform, $a_i$ should be $0$. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.\n\nNote that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$, ..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$, ..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.\n\nSee example outputs for better understanding.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 2\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 1 0 2 2 0 3 \n\nInput\n10 1 11\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nInput\n10 1 5\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$. The sequence of jumps you perform is $0 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 7 \\rightarrow 8$.\n\nConsider the second example: it does not matter how to place the platform because you always can jump from $0$ to $11$.\n\nConsider the third example: the answer is $[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.

You decided to implement an analog sorting algorithm yourself, but as you survey your pantry you realize you're out of spaghetti! The only type of pasta you have is ravioli, but you are not going to let this stop you...\n\nYou come up with the following algorithm. For each number in the array a_{i}, build a stack of a_{i} ravioli. The image shows the stack for a_{i} = 4.\n\n [Image] \n\nArrange the stacks in one row in the order in which the corresponding numbers appear in the input array. Find the tallest one (if there are several stacks of maximal height, use the leftmost one). Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array. Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them. Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removed.\n\nAt first you are very happy with your algorithm, but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesn't always produce the right sorted array. Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.\n\nGiven an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of input contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the elements of the array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput \"YES\" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and \"NO\" if it can not.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3\n3 1 2\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second example the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time: ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2}.", "gold_completion": "n = int(input())\na = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\nwhile len(a)!=1:\n    \n    m = a[0]\n    im = 0\n    for i in range(1,len(a)):\n        if abs(a[i] - a[i-1])>=2:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        if a[i]>m:\n            m = a[i]\n            im = i\n    a.pop(im)\nprint(\"YES\")", "gen_completion": "```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Check if the algorithm can sort the array correctly\ncan_sort = True\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    if abs(a[i] - a[i+1]) >= 2:\n        can_sort = False\n\nprint(\"YES\" if can_sort else \"NO\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The algorithm iterates over the array and checks if the difference between the current element and the next element is two or more.

{"problem_id": 4088, "question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Polycarp wrote on the board a string $s$ containing only lowercase Latin letters ('a'-'z'). This string is known for you and given in the input.\n\nAfter that, he erased some letters from the string $s$, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string $t$. You have to find it with some additional information.\n\nSuppose that the string $t$ has length $m$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $m$. You are given a sequence of $m$ integers: $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$, where $b_i$ is the sum of the distances $|i-j|$ from the index $i$ to all such indices $j$ that $t_j > t_i$ (consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate $b_i$, Polycarp finds all such indices $j$ that the index $j$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $t_i$ and sums all the values $|i-j|$.\n\nFor example, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then:  since $t_1$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$;  since $t_2$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_2=|2-3|=1$;  since $t_3$='z', then there are no indexes $j$ such that $t_j>t_i$, thus $b_3=0$;  since $t_4$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_4=|4-3|=1$. \n\nThus, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then $b=[6,1,0,1]$.\n\nGiven the string $s$ and the array $b$, find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:  $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;  the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.

Your task is to distribute all $n$ problems between $k$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.\n\nFor example, if $n = 8, k = 3$ and $a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$.

A sequence $[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$ is called an arithmetic progression if for each $i$ ($1 \\le i < n$) the value $a_{i+1} - a_i$ is the same. For example, the sequences $[42]$, $[5, 5, 5]$, $[2, 11, 20, 29]$ and $[3, 2, 1, 0]$ are arithmetic progressions, but $[1, 0, 1]$, $[1, 3, 9]$ and $[2, 3, 1]$ are not.\n\nIt follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.\n\nPolycarp found some sequence of positive integers $[b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n]$. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by $1$, an element can be increased by $1$, an element can be left unchanged.\n\nDetermine a minimum possible number of elements in $b$ which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence $b$ becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.\n\nIt is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals $0$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000)$ \u2014 the number of elements in $b$.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ $(1 \\le b_i \\le 10^{9})$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with described operations, print -1. In the other case, print non-negative integer \u2014 the minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes an arithmetic progression.

So, after Polycarp changed three elements by one, his sequence became equals to $[25, 20, 15, 10]$, which is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp should not change anything, because his sequence is an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the third example it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression.\n\nIn the fourth example Polycarp should change only the first element, he should decrease it on one.

You are controlling this robot and controlling how he goes. The robot has a battery and an accumulator with a solar panel.\n\nThe $i$-th segment of the path (from $X=i-1$ to $X=i$) can be exposed to sunlight or not. The array $s$ denotes which segments are exposed to sunlight: if segment $i$ is exposed, then $s_i = 1$, otherwise $s_i = 0$.\n\nThe robot has one battery of capacity $b$ and one accumulator of capacity $a$. For each segment, you should choose which type of energy storage robot will use to go to the next point (it can be either battery or accumulator). If the robot goes using the battery, the current charge of the battery is decreased by one (the robot can't use the battery if its charge is zero). And if the robot goes using the accumulator, the current charge of the accumulator is decreased by one (and the robot also can't use the accumulator if its charge is zero).\n\nIf the current segment is exposed to sunlight and the robot goes through it using the battery, the charge of the accumulator increases by one (of course, its charge can't become higher than it's maximum capacity).\n\nIf accumulator is used to pass some segment, its charge decreases by 1 no matter if the segment is exposed or not.\n\nYou understand that it is not always possible to walk to $X=n$.

You can assume that the number of rooms which have a spot for a router is not greater than the number of routers you have.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of rooms and the range of each router.\n\nThe second line of the input contains one string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of zeros and ones. If the $i$-th character of the string equals to '1' then there is a spot for a router in the $i$-th room. If the $i$-th character of the string equals to '0' then you cannot place a router in the $i$-th room.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum total cost of connecting all $n$ rooms to the Internet.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n00100\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n6 1\n000000\n\nOutput\n21\n\nInput\n4 1\n0011\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n12 6\n000010000100\n\nOutput\n15\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it is enough to place the router in the room $3$, then all rooms will be connected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is $3$.\n\nIn the second example you can place routers nowhere, so you need to connect all rooms directly. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\n\nIn the third example you need to connect the room $1$ directly and place the router in the room $3$. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nIn the fourth example you need to place routers in rooms $5$ and $10$. Then all rooms will be connected to the Internet.

Vova's parents, grandparents, grand-grandparents contributed to it. Now it's totally up to Vova to put the finishing touches.\n\nThe current state of the wall can be respresented by a sequence $a$ of $n$ integers, with $a_i$ being the height of the $i$-th part of the wall.\n\nVova can only use $2 \\times 1$ bricks to put in the wall (he has infinite supply of them, however).\n\nVova can put bricks horizontally on the neighboring parts of the wall of equal height. It means that if for some $i$ the current height of part $i$ is the same as for part $i + 1$, then Vova can put a brick there and thus increase both heights by 1. Obviously, Vova can't put bricks in such a way that its parts turn out to be off the borders (to the left of part $1$ of the wall or to the right of part $n$ of it).\n\nThe next paragraph is specific to the version 1 of the problem.\n\nVova can also put bricks vertically. That means increasing height of any part of the wall by 2.\n\nVova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when:\n\n  all parts of the wall has the same height;  the wall has no empty spaces inside it. \n\nCan Vova complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero)?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of parts in the wall.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the initial heights of the parts of the wall.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" if Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).\n\nPrint \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n2 1 1 2 5\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3\n4 5 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n2\n10 10\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Vova can put a brick on parts 2 and 3 to make the wall $[2, 2, 2, 2, 5]$ and then put 3 bricks on parts 1 and 2 and 3 bricks on parts 3 and 4 to make it $[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]$.\n\nIn the second example Vova can put a brick vertically on part 3 to make the wall $[4, 5, 5]$, then horizontally on parts 2 and 3 to make it $[4, 6, 6]$ and then vertically on part 1 to make it $[6, 6, 6]$.\n\nIn the third example the wall is already complete.", "gold_completion": "n=int(input())\nl=[]\nfor i in input().split():\n    tmp=1&int(i)\n    if l==[] or l[-1]!=tmp: l.append(tmp)\n    else: l.pop()\n\nprint(\"YES\" if len(l)<2 else \"NO\")", "gen_completion": "```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Check if the wall can be completed\ncan_complete = (max(a) - min(a)) % 2 == 0 and all(a[i] == a[i-1] for i in range(2, len(a)))\n\n# Print YES/NO\nprint(\"YES\" if can_complete else \"NO\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The code reads the number of parts in the wall `n` and then reads the initial heights of each part `a`.\n* It calculates the maximum and minimum heights in the wall and checks if the difference between them is divisible by 2. This is because Vova can only put bricks horizontally or vertically, so the difference between the maximum and minimum heights must be divisible by 2 for him to complete the wall.\n* If the difference is divisible by 2 and all parts of the wall have the same height, it means that Vova can complete the wall.

After some hesitation he decided to give them the array that he got as a present in Codeforces Round #153 (Div.2). The scientists rejoiced at the gift and decided to put some important facts to this array. Here are the first few of the facts: The highest mountain above sea level in the world is Mount Everest. Its peak rises to 8848 m.  The largest board game tournament consisted of 958 participants playing chapaev. The largest online maths competition consisted of 12766 participants. The Nile is credited as the longest river in the world. From its farthest stream in Burundi, it extends 6695 km in length. While not in flood, the main stretches of the Amazon river in South America can reach widths of up to 1100 km at its widest points. Angel Falls is the highest waterfall. Its greatest single drop measures 807 m. The Hotel Everest View above Namche, Nepal \u2014 the village closest to Everest base camp \u2013 is at a record height of 31962 m Uranium is the heaviest of all the naturally occurring elements. Its most common isotope has a nucleus containing 146 neutrons. The coldest permanently inhabited place is the Siberian village of Oymyakon, where the temperature of -68\u00b0C was registered in the twentieth century. The longest snake held in captivity is over 25 feet long. Its name is Medusa. Colonel Meow holds the world record for longest fur on a cat \u2014 almost 134 centimeters. Sea otters can have up to 10000 hairs per square inch. This is the most dense fur in the animal kingdom. The largest state of USA is Alaska; its area is 663268 square miles Alaska has a longer coastline than all of the other 49 U.S. States put together: it is 154103 miles long. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in the world. It reaches 1642\u00a0meters in depth and contains around one-fifth of the world\u2019s unfrozen fresh water.

{"problem_id": 4206, "question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Polycarp likes numbers that are divisible by 3.\n\nHe has a huge number $s$. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by $3$. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.\n\nFor example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.\n\nPolycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0'). For example, 007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10001 are valid.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of numbers divisible by $3$ that Polycarp can obtain?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer $s$.

The specified number 6 forms one number that is divisible by $3$.\n\nIn the third example, cuts must be made between each pair of digits. As a result, Polycarp gets one digit 1 and $33$ digits 0. Each of the $33$ digits 0 forms a number that is divisible by $3$.\n\nIn the fourth example, an example set of optimal cuts is 2|0|1|9|201|81.
