{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Anton likes to listen to fairy tales, especially when Danik, Anton's best friend, tells them. Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain.

If `m` is 0, it means no grains are brought, so the function returns `n`, which is the number of days until the barn is empty.\n\nThe function starts with `day` set to 1, representing the first day. While `n` is greater than 0, the number of grains brought is added to the barn, and then the number of sparrows that day is subtracted. If `n` becomes less than 0, it is set to 0, representing an empty barn. The function then increments `day` and repeats the process until `n` is 0.\n\nThe inputs `n` and `m` are taken from the user, and the `sparrow_eats_grain` function is called with those inputs.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Daniel is organizing a football tournament. He has come up with the following tournament format:   In the first several (possibly zero) stages, while the number of teams is even, they split in pairs and play one game for each pair. At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are x teams, there will be $\\frac{x \\cdot(x - 1)}{2}$ games), and the tournament ends. \n\nFor example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament.

That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. \n\nWhile watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to w meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to b meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). \n\nNote that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance L.\n\nSince the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to t (both are included).

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. \n\nVasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.\n\nHelp Vasya!

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively.

It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\").

Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

For example, if the bar is 16 \u00d7 23, then Polycarpus can chip off a half, but not a third. If the bar is 20 \u00d7 18, then Polycarpus can chip off both a half and a third. If the bar is 5 \u00d7 7, then Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of minutes Polycarpus needs to make two bars consist of the same number of squares? Find not only the required minimum number of minutes, but also the possible sizes of the bars after the process.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers a_1, b_1 (1 \u2264 a_1, b_1 \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the initial sizes of the first chocolate bar. The second line of the input contains integers a_2, b_2 (1 \u2264 a_2, b_2 \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the initial sizes of the second bar.\n\nYou can use the data of type int64 (in Pascal), long long (in \u0421++), long (in Java) to process large integers (exceeding 2^31 - 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print m \u2014 the sought minimum number of minutes. In the second and third line print the possible sizes of the bars after they are leveled in m minutes. Print the sizes using the format identical to the input format. Print the sizes (the numbers in the printed pairs) in any order. The second line must correspond to the first bar and the third line must correspond to the second bar. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nIf there is no solution, print a single line with integer -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 6\n2 3\n\nOutput\n1\n1 6\n2 3\n\nInput\n36 5\n10 16\n\nOutput\n3\n16 5\n5 16\n\nInput\n3 5\n2 1\n\nOutput\n-1", "gold_completion": "f = lambda: map(int, input().split())\na, b = f()\nc, d = f()\n\n\ndef g(p, k):\n    s = 1\n    while k % p ** s == 0: s += 1\n    return s - 1\n\n\na3, b3, c3, d3 = g(3, a), g(3, b), g(3, c), g(3, d)\na2, b2, c2, d2 = g(2, a), g(2, b), g(2, c), g(2, d)\n\nab3, cd3 = a3 + b3, c3 + d3\nab2, cd2 = a2 + b2, c2 + d2\n\nab = a * b * pow(2, cd2) * pow(3, cd3)\ncd = c * d * pow(2, ab2) * pow(3, ab3)\nif ab != cd:\n    print(-1)\n    return\n\nk, s2, s3 = 1e9, 0, 0\n\nfor t3 in range(min(ab3, cd3) + 1):\n    k3 = ab3 + cd3 - 2 * t3\n    for t2 in range(min(ab2 + ab3, cd2 + cd3) - t3 + 1):\n        k2 = k3 + ab2 + cd2 - 2 * t2\n\n        if k2 + k3 < k:\n            k = k2 + k3\n            s2, s3 = t2, t3\n\nt3 = ab3 - s3\nwhile t3 and a % 3 == 0:\n    a = 2 * a // 3\n    t3 -= 1\nwhile t3 and b % 3 == 0:\n    b = 2 * b // 3\n    t3 -= 1\nt2 = ab3 - s3 + ab2 - s2\nwhile t2 and a % 2 == 0:\n    a = a // 2\n    t2 -= 1\nwhile t2 and b % 2 == 0:\n    b = b // 2\n    t2 -= 1\nt3 = cd3 - s3\nwhile t3 and c % 3 == 0:\n    c = 2 * c // 3\n    t3 -= 1\nwhile t3 and d % 3 == 0:\n    d = 2 * d // 3\n    t3 -= 1\nt2 = cd3 - s3 + cd2 - s2\nwhile t2 and c % 2 == 0:\n    c = c // 2\n    t2 -= 1\nwhile t2 and d % 2 == 0:\n    d = d // 2\n    t2 -= 1\n\nprint(k)\nprint(a, b)\nprint(c, d)", "gen_completion": "\nHere is the Python 3 code to solve the question:\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the number of squares in a bar\ndef number_of_squares(a, b):\n    return (a*b) // (min(a, b)**2)\n\n# Function to find the number of minutes to make two bars equal\ndef make_equal(a1, b1, a2, b2):\n    # Initialize the minimum number of minutes\n    min_minutes = float('inf')\n    # Check if it's possible to make the bars equal\n    if (a1 * b1) % (a2 * b2) == 0 or (a2 * b2) % (a1 * b1) == 0:\n        # Generate all possible bar sizes after cutting the bars\n        for a in range(1, min(a1, a2) + 1):\n            for b in range(1, min(b1, b2) + 1):\n                # Check if the bars are equal after cutting\n                if number_of_squares(a1, b1) == number_of_squares(a, b):\n                    # Calculate the number of minutes required\n                    minutes = (a1 - a) + (b1 - b)\n                    # Update the minimum number of minutes\n                    min_minutes = min(min_minutes, minutes)\n                if number_of_squares(a2, b2) == number_of_squares(a, b):\n                    # Calculate the number of minutes required\n                    minutes = (a2 - a) + (b2 - b)\n                    # Update the minimum number of minutes\n                    min_minutes = min(min_minutes, minutes)\n    else:\n        # If it's not possible to make the bars equal, return -1\n        return -1\n    return min_minutes\n\n# Read the input from the user\na1, b1 = map(int, input().split())\na2, b2 = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Call the make_equal function to find the number of minutes\nminutes = make_equal(a1, b1, a2, b2)\n", "parsed_codes": "# Function to calculate the number of squares in a bar\ndef number_of_squares(a, b):\n    return (a*b) // (min(a, b)**2)\n\n# Function to find the number of minutes to make two bars equal\ndef make_equal(a1, b1, a2, b2):\n    # Initialize the minimum number of minutes\n    min_minutes = float('inf')\n    # Check if it's possible to make the bars equal\n    if (a1 * b1) % (a2 * b2) == 0 or (a2 * b2) % (a1 * b1) == 0:\n        # Generate all possible bar sizes after cutting the bars\n        for a in range(1, min(a1, a2) + 1):\n            for b in range(1, min(b1, b2) + 1):\n                # Check if the bars are equal after cutting\n                if number_of_squares(a1, b1) == number_of_squares(a, b):\n                    # Calculate the number of minutes required\n                    minutes = (a1 - a) + (b1 - b)\n                    # Update the minimum number of minutes\n                    min_minutes = min(min_minutes, minutes)\n                if number_of_squares(a2, b2) == number_of_squares(a, b):\n                    # Calculate the number of minutes required\n                    minutes = (a2 - a) + (b2 - b)\n                    # Update the minimum number of minutes\n                    min_minutes = min(min_minutes, minutes)\n    else:\n        # If it's not possible to make the bars equal, return -1\n        return -1\n    return min_minutes\n\n# Read the input from the user\na1, b1 = map(int, input().split())\na2, b2 = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Call the make_equal function to find the number of minutes\nminutes = make_equal(a1, b1, a2, b2)"}

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Masha really loves algebra. On the last lesson, her strict teacher Dvastan gave she new exercise.\n\nYou are given geometric progression b defined by two integers b_1 and q. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., where for each i > 1 the respective term satisfies the condition b_{i} = b_{i} - 1\u00b7q, where q is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both b_1 and q can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha m \"bad\" integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m}, and an integer l.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |b_{i}| \u2264 l is satisfied (|x| means absolute value of x). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains four integers b_1, q, l, m (-10^9 \u2264 b_1, q \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of \"bad\" integers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains m distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (-10^9 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 numbers that will never be written on the board.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer, meaning the number of progression terms that will be written on the board if it is finite, or \"inf\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2 30 4\n6 14 25 48\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n123 1 2143435 4\n123 11 -5453 141245\n\nOutput\n0\nInput\n123 1 2143435 4\n54343 -13 6 124\n\nOutput\ninf\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, Masha will write integers 3, 12, 24. Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a \"bad\" integer. Terms bigger than 24 won't be written because they exceed l by absolute value.\n\nIn the second case, Masha won't write any number because all terms are equal 123 and this is a \"bad\" integer.\n\nIn the third case, Masha will write infinitely integers 123.", "gold_completion": "B1, Q, L, M = list(map(int, input().split()))\nAs = set(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBs = []\ntmp = B1\ncnt = 0\nwhile abs(tmp) <= L and cnt < 100:\n    if tmp not in As:\n        Bs.append(tmp)\n    tmp *= Q\n    cnt += 1\nif 32 < len(Bs):\n    print('inf')\nelse:\n    print(len(Bs))\n", "gen_completion": "\n\n Here is the Python3 code for solving the question:\n\n```python\ndef solve(b_1, q, l, m, bad_numbers):\n    if b_1 == 0 and q == 0:\n        return \"inf\"\n    if b_1 == 0 and q == 1:\n        return 0\n    if b_1 == 0 and q == -1:\n        return 0\n\n    current_term = b_1\n    bad_numbers = set(bad_numbers)\n    count = 0\n\n    while abs(current_term) <= l:\n        if current_term not in bad_numbers:\n            count += 1\n        current_term = current_term * q\n\n    if count == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return count\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    b_1, q, l, m = map(int, input().split())\n    bad_numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    result = solve(b_1, q, l, m, bad_numbers)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function `solve` that takes in the initial term `b_1`, the common ratio `q`, the absolute value of the maximal number that can be written on the board `l`, the number of \"bad\" integers `m`, and a list of `bad_numbers`.\n\nInside the function, we handle some special cases where `b_1` and `q` are zero, and return the appropriate output.\n\nIf none of the special cases apply, we initialize the `current_term` to `b_1`, convert the `bad_numbers` list into a set for faster lookup, and initialize the `count` to zero.\n\nIn a while loop, we check if the absolute value of the `current_term` is less than or equal to `l`. If it is, we check if the `current_term` is not in the `bad_numbers` set.
