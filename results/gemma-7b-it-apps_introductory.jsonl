If there are multiple answers, you can print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 4 3 2\n\nOutput\n4\nLRRR\n\nInput\n7\n1 3 5 6 5 4 2\n\nOutput\n6\nLRLRRR\n\nInput\n3\n2 2 2\n\nOutput\n1\nR\n\nInput\n4\n1 2 4 3\n\nOutput\n4\nLLRR\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.", "gold_completion": "\nn = int(input())\n\narr = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))\n\nfl = 1\n\nans = \"\"\nc = 0\n\nst = 0\nen = n-1\n\nla = 0\nfloop = 0\nwhile fl:\n    if st>=n or en<=-1:\n        \n        break\n\n    if arr[st]==arr[en]:\n        floop =1\n        break;\n\n    \n    if arr[st] > la:\n        if arr[en]>la:\n            if arr[en] > arr[st]:\n                st+=1\n                la = arr[st-1]\n                ans+=\"L\"\n                c+=1\n            else:\n                en-=1\n                la  = arr[en+1]\n                ans+=\"R\"\n                c+=1\n        else:\n            st+=1\n            la = arr[st-1]\n            ans+=\"L\"\n            c+=1\n    else:\n        if arr[en]>la:\n            en-=1\n            la =arr[en+1]\n            ans+=\"R\"\n            c+=1\n        else:\n            break;\n#print(floop)\nif floop == 1:\n    orig = la\n    cm = 0\n    s1 = \"\"\n    for i in range(st,en+1):\n        if arr[i]>la:\n            la = arr[i]\n            cm+=1\n            s1+=\"L\"\n        else:\n            break;\n    cn = 0\n    s2 = \"\"\n    la = orig\n    for i in range(en,st-1,-1):\n        if la < arr[i]:\n            cn+=1\n            s2+=\"R\"\n            la = arr[i]\n        else:\n            break;\n    if cn>cm:\n        ans+=s2\n    else:\n        \n        ans+=s1\n    c+=max(cn,cm)\n    ##print(s1,s2)\n\n    \n    \nprint(c)\nprint(ans)\n                \n", "gen_completion": "```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\nk = len(set(a))\ns = \"\"\n\nfor i in range(k):\n    if a[i] == a[i-1]:\n        s += \"L\"\n    else:\n        s += \"R\"\n\nprint(k)\nprint(s)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The code reads the number of elements `n` and the sequence `a`.\n* It sorts the sequence in ascending order and removes duplicates, resulting in a sequence of distinct elements.\n* The length of the sequence is stored in `k`.\n* The code constructs a string `s` of length `k`, where 'L' represents taking the leftmost element and 'R' represents taking the rightmost element.\n* The final string `s` is printed.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n* The code spends time sorting the sequence, which takes O(nlogn) time.\n* The code also spends time removing duplicates, which takes O(n) time.\n* Overall, the time complexity is O(nlogn).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\n* The code uses a set to remove duplicates, which has a space complexity of O(n).\n* The code also uses a string of length `k`, which has a space complexity of O(k).\n* Overall, the space complexity is O(n) + O(k).", "parsed_codes": "n = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\nk = len(set(a))\ns = \"\"\n\nfor i in range(k):\n    if a[i] == a[i-1]:\n        s += \"L\"\n    else:\n        s += \"R\"\n\nprint(k)\nprint(s)"}

For the $i$-th exam Petya should prepare in days between $s_i$ and $d_i-1$, inclusive. \n\nThere are three types of activities for Petya in each day: to spend a day doing nothing (taking a rest), to spend a day passing exactly one exam or to spend a day preparing for exactly one exam. So he can't pass/prepare for multiple exams in a day. He can't mix his activities in a day. If he is preparing for the $i$-th exam in day $j$, then $s_i \\le j < d_i$.\n\nIt is allowed to have breaks in a preparation to an exam and to alternate preparations for different exams in consecutive days.

It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.\n\nNote that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).\n\nFor example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:\n\n [Image] The first example: $n=7$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n, m, d \\le 1000, m \\le n$) \u2014 the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n, \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array $a$ of length $n$ in the second line \u2014 the sequence of river cells (excluding cell $0$ and cell $n + 1$).\n\nIf the cell $i$ does not belong to any platform, $a_i$ should be $0$. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.\n\nNote that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$, ..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$, ..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.\n\nSee example outputs for better understanding.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 2\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 1 0 2 2 0 3 \n\nInput\n10 1 11\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nInput\n10 1 5\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Everybody knows of spaghetti sort. You decided to implement an analog sorting algorithm yourself, but as you survey your pantry you realize you're out of spaghetti! The only type of pasta you have is ravioli, but you are not going to let this stop you...\n\nYou come up with the following algorithm. For each number in the array a_{i}, build a stack of a_{i} ravioli. The image shows the stack for a_{i} = 4.\n\n [Image] \n\nArrange the stacks in one row in the order in which the corresponding numbers appear in the input array. Find the tallest one (if there are several stacks of maximal height, use the leftmost one). Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array. Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them. Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removed.\n\nAt first you are very happy with your algorithm, but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesn't always produce the right sorted array. Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.\n\nGiven an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of input contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the elements of the array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput \"YES\" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and \"NO\" if it can not.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3\n3 1 2\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second example the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time: ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2}.", "gold_completion": "n = int(input())\na = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\nwhile len(a)!=1:\n    \n    m = a[0]\n    im = 0\n    for i in range(1,len(a)):\n        if abs(a[i] - a[i-1])>=2:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        if a[i]>m:\n            m = a[i]\n            im = i\n    a.pop(im)\nprint(\"YES\")", "gen_completion": "```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Check if the algorithm can sort the array correctly\ncan_sort = True\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    if abs(a[i] - a[i+1]) >= 2:\n        can_sort = False\n\nprint(\"YES\" if can_sort else \"NO\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The algorithm iterates over the array and checks if the difference between the current element and the next element is two or more.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Vova's house is an array consisting of $n$ elements (yeah, this is the first problem, I think, where someone lives in the array).
