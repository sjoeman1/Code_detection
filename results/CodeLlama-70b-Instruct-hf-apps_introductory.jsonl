{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: There is a river of width $n$. The left bank of the river is cell $0$ and the right bank is cell $n + 1$ (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of $n + 2$ cells numbered from $0$ to $n + 1$). There are also $m$ wooden platforms on a river, the $i$-th platform has length $c_i$ (so the $i$-th platform takes $c_i$ consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed $n$.\n\nYou are standing at $0$ and want to reach $n+1$ somehow. If you are standing at the position $x$, you can jump to any position in the range $[x + 1; x + d]$. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if $d=1$, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells $0$ and $n+1$ belong to wooden platforms.\n\nYou want to know if it is possible to reach $n+1$ from $0$ if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.\n\nNote that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).\n\nFor example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:\n\n [Image] The first example: $n=7$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n, m, d \\le 1000, m \\le n$) \u2014 the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n, \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line.

Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.\n\nNote that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$, ..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$, ..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.\n\nSee example outputs for better understanding.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 2\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 1 0 2 2 0 3 \n\nInput\n10 1 11\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nInput\n10 1 5\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$.

Such strings are called ternary strings.\n\nYour task is to replace minimum number of characters in this string with other characters to obtain a balanced ternary string (balanced ternary string is a ternary string such that the number of characters '0' in this string is equal to the number of characters '1', and the number of characters '1' (and '0' obviously) is equal to the number of characters '2').\n\nAmong all possible balanced ternary strings you have to obtain the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest.\n\nNote that you can neither remove characters from the string nor add characters to the string. Also note that you can replace the given characters only with characters '0', '1' and '2'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer exists.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$, $n$ is divisible by $3$) \u2014 the number of characters in $s$.\n\nThe second line contains the string $s$ consisting of exactly $n$ characters '0', '1' and '2'.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one string \u2014 the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest balanced ternary string which can be obtained from the given one with minimum number of replacements.\n\nBecause $n$ is divisible by $3$ it is obvious that the answer exists.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Polycarp wrote on the board a string $s$ containing only lowercase Latin letters ('a'-'z'). This string is known for you and given in the input.\n\nAfter that, he erased some letters from the string $s$, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string $t$. You have to find it with some additional information.\n\nSuppose that the string $t$ has length $m$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $m$. You are given a sequence of $m$ integers: $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$, where $b_i$ is the sum of the distances $|i-j|$ from the index $i$ to all such indices $j$ that $t_j > t_i$ (consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate $b_i$, Polycarp finds all such indices $j$ that the index $j$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $t_i$ and sums all the values $|i-j|$.\n\nFor example, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then:  since $t_1$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$;  since $t_2$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_2=|2-3|=1$;  since $t_3$='z', then there are no indexes $j$ such that $t_j>t_i$, thus $b_3=0$;  since $t_4$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_4=|4-3|=1$. \n\nThus, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then $b=[6,1,0,1]$.\n\nGiven the string $s$ and the array $b$, find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:  $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;  the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Then $q$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines:  the first line contains string $s$, which has a length from $1$ to $50$ and consists of lowercase English letters;  the second line contains positive integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le |s|$), where $|s|$ is the length of the string $s$, and $m$ is the length of the array $b$;  the third line contains the integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m$ ($0 \\le b_i \\le 1225$). \n\nIt is guaranteed that in each test case an answer exists.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $q$ lines: the $k$-th of them should contain the answer (string $t$) to the $k$-th test case.
