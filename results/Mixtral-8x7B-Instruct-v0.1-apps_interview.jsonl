{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Anton likes to listen to fairy tales, especially when Danik, Anton's best friend, tells them. Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn.

The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.\n\nAll levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\n\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\n\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers \u2014 $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.\n\nHelp him to check the correctness of his records.\n\nFor your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \\le T \\le 500)$ \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \\le p_i, c_i \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.\n\nNote that the stats are given in chronological order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single line.\n\nIf there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print \"YES\".\n\nOtherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2\n1 0\n1000 3\n4\n10 1\n15 2\n10 2\n15 2\n1\n765 432\n2\n4 4\n4 3\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.\n\nThe second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.\n\nIn the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.\n\nThe fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.\n\nIn the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.\n\nNobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.", "gold_completion": "import sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    lastP = 0\n    lastC = 0\n    works = True\n    for _ in range(n):\n        p, c = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        pDiff = p-lastP\n        cDiff = c-lastC\n        if 0 <= cDiff <= pDiff:\n            pass\n        else:\n            works = False\n        lastP = p\n        lastC = c\n    if works:\n        print('YES')\n    else:\n        print('NO')\n", "gen_completion": " Here is a Python3 solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef check\\_records(n: int, stats: list) -> str:\nrecord\\_plays = [0]\nrecord\\_clears = [0]\nfor play, clear in stats:\nif play < record\\_plays[-1]:\nreturn \"NO\"\nrecord\\_plays.append(play)\nif clear < record\\_clears[-1]:\nreturn \"NO\"\nrecord\\_clears.append(clear)\nreturn \"YES\"\n\nT = int(input().strip())\nfor t in range(T):\nn = int(input().strip())\nstats = [list(map(int, input().strip().split())) for \\_ in range(n)]\nprint(\"YES\" if check\\_records(n, stats) == \"YES\" else \"NO\")\n```\n\nThe solution defines a helper function `check_records` that takes in the number of moments `n` and a list of tuples `stats` representing the number of plays and clears at each moment.

For longer strings, we initialize the i-th element of the dp array to i, as that is the maximum number of operations required to type the first i characters. Then, for each i from 2 to n, we check if the i-th character is the same as any of the previous characters. If it is, we update dp[i] to be the minimum of its current value and dp[j] + 1, where j is the index of the previous character that matches the i-th character. Finally, we return dp[n] as the answer.\n\nNote that the additional operation of copying the string and appending it to itself is not explicitly used in the solution, as it is not necessary to achieve the minimum number of operations.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.\n\nUnfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess.

It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.\n\nThe only operation Vladimir can perform is the \"move\" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is \"move file_1 file_2\", that means that the file \"file_1\" is to be renamed to \"file_2\". If there is a file \"file_2\" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Daniel is organizing a football tournament.

At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends.

Students like to dream of a beautiful life, so they used champagne glasses to construct a small pyramid. The height of the pyramid is n. The top level consists of only 1 glass, that stands on 2 glasses on the second level (counting from the top), then 3 glasses on the third level and so on.The bottom level consists of n glasses.\n\nVlad has seen in the movies many times how the champagne beautifully flows from top levels to bottom ones, filling all the glasses simultaneously. So he took a bottle and started to pour it in the glass located at the top of the pyramid.\n\nEach second, Vlad pours to the top glass the amount of champagne equal to the size of exactly one glass. If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table. For the purpose of this problem we consider that champagne is distributed among pyramid glasses immediately.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$.

Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\").

Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Masha really loves algebra. On the last lesson, her strict teacher Dvastan gave she new exercise.\n\nYou are given geometric progression b defined by two integers b_1 and q. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., where for each i > 1 the respective term satisfies the condition b_{i} = b_{i} - 1\u00b7q, where q is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both b_1 and q can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha m \"bad\" integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m}, and an integer l.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |b_{i}| \u2264 l is satisfied (|x| means absolute value of x). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains four integers b_1, q, l, m (-10^9 \u2264 b_1, q \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of \"bad\" integers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains m distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (-10^9 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 numbers that will never be written on the board.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer, meaning the number of progression terms that will be written on the board if it is finite, or \"inf\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2 30 4\n6 14 25 48\n\nOutput\n3\nInput\n123 1 2143435 4\n123 11 -5453 141245\n\nOutput\n0\nInput\n123 1 2143435 4\n54343 -13 6 124\n\nOutput\ninf\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case, Masha will write integers 3, 12, 24. Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a \"bad\" integer. Terms bigger than 24 won't be written because they exceed l by absolute value.\n\nIn the second case, Masha won't write any number because all terms are equal 123 and this is a \"bad\" integer.\n\nIn the third case, Masha will write infinitely integers 123.", "gold_completion": "B1, Q, L, M = list(map(int, input().split()))\nAs = set(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBs = []\ntmp = B1\ncnt = 0\nwhile abs(tmp) <= L and cnt < 100:\n    if tmp not in As:\n        Bs.append(tmp)\n    tmp *= Q\n    cnt += 1\nif 32 < len(Bs):\n    print('inf')\nelse:\n    print(len(Bs))\n", "gen_completion": " Here's a Python3 solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef will\\_write(b\\_1, q, l, bad\\_numbers):\nnumbers = set()\ni = 1\nn = b\\_1\nwhile True:\nif n in numbers or n in bad\\_numbers:\ni += 1\nn = b\\_1 \\* q**i\ncontinue\nnumbers.add(n)\nif abs(n) > l:\nreturn len(numbers) if len(numbers) < float('inf') else 'inf'\ni += 1\n\nb\\_1, q, l, m = map(int, input().split())\nbad\\_numbers = set(map(int, input().split()))\n\nresult = will\\_write(b\\_1, q, l, bad\\_numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe function `will_write` calculates the number of progression terms that will be written on the board. It uses a while loop to iterate through the geometric progression and adds each term to a set called `numbers`. If the term is in the `bad_numbers` set or already exists in the `numbers` set, it skips the term and moves forward to the next term. If the absolute value of the term is greater than `l`, it returns the length of the `numbers` set if it's not infinite, or `inf` otherwise.\n\nThe script then reads the input, creates the `bad_numbers` set, and calls the `will_write` function to get the result. Finally, it prints the result.", "parsed_codes": "def will\\_write(b\\_1, q, l, bad\\_numbers):\nnumbers = set()\ni = 1\nn = b\\_1\nwhile True:\nif n in numbers or n in bad\\_numbers:\ni += 1\nn = b\\_1 \\* q**i\ncontinue\nnumbers.add(n)\nif abs(n) > l:\nreturn len(numbers) if len(numbers) < float('inf') else 'inf'\ni += 1\n\nb\\_1, q, l, m = map(int, input().split())\nbad\\_numbers = set(map(int, input().split()))\n\nresult = will\\_write(b\\_1, q, l, bad\\_numbers)\nprint(result)"}
