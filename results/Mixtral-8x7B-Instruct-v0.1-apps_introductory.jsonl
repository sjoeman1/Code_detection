{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: You are given an unweighted tree with $n$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.\n\nYour task is to choose three distinct vertices $a, b, c$ on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ is the maximum possible. See the notes section for a better understanding.\n\nThe simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree. \n\nNext $n - 1$ lines describe the edges of the tree in form $a_i, b_i$ ($1 \\le a_i$, $b_i \\le n$, $a_i \\ne b_i$).

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: There is a river of width $n$. The left bank of the river is cell $0$ and the right bank is cell $n + 1$ (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of $n + 2$ cells numbered from $0$ to $n + 1$). There are also $m$ wooden platforms on a river, the $i$-th platform has length $c_i$ (so the $i$-th platform takes $c_i$ consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed $n$.\n\nYou are standing at $0$ and want to reach $n+1$ somehow. If you are standing at the position $x$, you can jump to any position in the range $[x + 1; x + d]$. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if $d=1$, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells $0$ and $n+1$ belong to wooden platforms.\n\nYou want to know if it is possible to reach $n+1$ from $0$ if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.\n\nNote that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).\n\nFor example, if $n=7$, $m=3$, $d=2$ and $c = [1, 2, 1]$, then one of the ways to reach $8$ from $0$ is follow:\n\n [Image] The first example: $n=7$. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $d$ ($1 \\le n, m, d \\le 1000, m \\le n$) \u2014 the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le n, \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\le n$), where $c_i$ is the length of the $i$-th platform.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to reach $n+1$ from $0$, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array $a$ of length $n$ in the second line \u2014 the sequence of river cells (excluding cell $0$ and cell $n + 1$).\n\nIf the cell $i$ does not belong to any platform, $a_i$ should be $0$. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform ($1$-indexed, platforms are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in order of input) to which the cell $i$ belongs.\n\nNote that all $a_i$ equal to $1$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_1$, all $a_i$ equal to $2$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_2$, ..., all $a_i$ equal to $m$ should form a contiguous subsegment of the array $a$ of length $c_m$. The leftmost position of $2$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $1$, the leftmost position of $3$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $2$, ..., the leftmost position of $m$ in $a$ should be greater than the rightmost position of $m-1$.\n\nSee example outputs for better understanding.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3 2\n1 2 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 1 0 2 2 0 3 \n\nInput\n10 1 11\n1\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nInput\n10 1 5\n2\n\nOutput\nYES\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example: the answer is $[0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]$.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: Polycarp wrote on the board a string $s$ containing only lowercase Latin letters ('a'-'z'). This string is known for you and given in the input.\n\nAfter that, he erased some letters from the string $s$, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string $t$. You have to find it with some additional information.\n\nSuppose that the string $t$ has length $m$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $1$ to $m$.

In other words, to calculate $b_i$, Polycarp finds all such indices $j$ that the index $j$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $t_i$ and sums all the values $|i-j|$.\n\nFor example, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then:  since $t_1$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$;  since $t_2$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_2=|2-3|=1$;  since $t_3$='z', then there are no indexes $j$ such that $t_j>t_i$, thus $b_3=0$;  since $t_4$='b', only the index $j=3$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $b_4=|4-3|=1$. \n\nThus, if $t$ = \"abzb\", then $b=[6,1,0,1]$.\n\nGiven the string $s$ and the array $b$, find any possible string $t$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:  $t$ is obtained from $s$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;  the array, constructed from the string $t$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $b$ specified in the input data. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.

{"question": "Provide me the Python3 codes for solving the question: You are given a text consisting of $n$ space-separated words. There is exactly one space character between any pair of adjacent words. There are no spaces before the first word and no spaces after the last word.

In order to perform an abbreviation, you have to choose at least two non-intersecting equal segments of words, and replace each chosen segment with the string consisting of first letters of the words in the segment (written in uppercase). For example, for the text \"a ab a a b ab a a b c\" you can replace segments of words $w[2..4]$ and $w[6..8]$ with an abbreviation \"AAA\" and obtain the text \"a AAA b AAA b c\", or you can replace segments of words $w[2..5]$ and $w[6..9]$ with an abbreviation \"AAAB\" and obtain the text \"a AAAB AAAB c\".\n\nWhat is the minimum length of the text after at most one abbreviation?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 300$) \u2014 the number of words in the text.\n\nThe next line contains $n$ space-separated words of the text $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$.

Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list.
